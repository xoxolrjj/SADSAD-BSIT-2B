The network is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with synaptic connections supplied by a memristor-based model of plasticity. Another mechanism for changing the synaptic connections involves astrocytic regulations using the concept of tripartite synapses. In the absence of memristor-based plasticity, the connections between these neurons drive the network dynamics into a burst mode, as observed in many experimental neurobiological studies when investigating living networks in neuronal cultures. The memristive plasticity implementing synaptic plasticity in inhibitory synapses results in a shift in network dynamics towards an asynchronous mode. Next,it is found that accounting for astrocytic regulation in glutamatergic excitatory synapses enable the restoration of normal burst dynamics. The conditions and parameters of such astrocytic regulations impact on burst dynamics established.',

However, the Gabor-like filters learned by classical sparse coding far overpredict well-tuned simple cell receptive field profiles observed empirically. While neurons fire sparsely, neuronal populations are also organized in physical space by their sensitivity to certain features. In V1, this organization is a smooth progression of orientations along the cortical sheet. A number of subsequent models have either discarded the sparse dictionary learning framework entirely or whose updates have yet to take advantage of the surge in unrolled, neural dictionary learning architectures. A key missing theme of these updates is a stronger notion of emph{structured sparsity}. We propose an autoencoder architecture (WLSC) whose latent representations are implicitly, locally organized for spectral clustering through a Laplacian quadratic form of a bipartite graph, which generates a diverse set of artificial receptive fields that match primate data in V1 as faithfully as recent contrastive frameworks like Local Low Dimensionality, or LLD citep{lld} that discard sparse dictionary learning. By unifying sparse and smooth coding in models of the early visual cortex through our autoencoder, we also show that our regularization can be interpreted as early-stage specialization of receptive fields to certain classes of stimuli; that is, we induce a weak clustering bias for later stages of cortex where functional and spatial segregation (i.e. topography) are known to occur. The results show an imperative for emph{spatial regularization} of both the receptive fields and firing rates to begin to describe feature disentanglement in V1 and beyond.',

Genetics are influenced by the environment, specifically the social experience during the critical neurodevelopmental period. Despite efficacy of early behavior interventions targeted specific behaviors in some autistic children, there is no sustainable treatment for the two core symptoms: deficits in social interaction and communication, and stereotyped or restrained behaviors or interests. In this study, we investigated the impact of the social environment on both wild-type (WT) and Shank3 knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model that reproduces core autism-like symptoms. Our findings revealed that WT mice raised in an enriched social environment maintained social interest towards new conspecifics across multiple trials. Additionally, we observed that 2 hours or chronic social isolation induced social deficits or enhanced social interaction and olfactory neuron responses in WT animals, respectively. Notably, chronic social isolation restored both social novelty and olfactory deficits, and normalized self-grooming behavior in Shank3 KO mice.

Here, we study systematically the time-dependent dynamics and (non-Markovian) memory effects of tracers in polymer networks based on (Markovian) implicit-solvent Langevin simulations. In particular, we consider spherical tracer solutes at high dilution in regular, tetrafunctional bead-spring polymer networks, and control the tracer-network Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions and the polymer density. Based on the analysis of the memory (friction) kernels, we recover the expected long-time transport coefficients, and demonstrate how the short-time tracer dynamics, polymer fluctuations, and the viscoelastic response are interlinked. Further, we fit the characteristic memory modes of the tracers with damped harmonic oscillations and identify LJ contributions, bond vibrations, and slow network relaxations, which enter the kernel with an almost linear scaling with the LJ attractions. This procedure proposes a reduced functional form for the tracer memory, allowing for a convenient inter- and extrapolation of the memory kernels. This leads eventually to highly efficient simulations utilizing the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), in which the polymer network acts as an additional thermal bath with tuneable intensity.',
