1,HunFlair2 in a cross-corpus evaluation of biomedical named entity recognition and normalization tools,"Mario Sänger, Samuele Garda, Xing David Wang, Leon Weber-Genzel, Pia Droop, Benedikt Fuchs, Alan Akbik, Ulf Leser",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"With the exponential growth of the life science literature, biomedical text mining (BTM) has become an essential technology for accelerating the extraction of insights from publications. Identifying named entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, or genes) in texts and their linkage to reference knowledge bases are crucial steps in BTM pipelines to enable information aggregation from different documents. However, tools for these two steps are rarely applied in the same context in which they were developed. Instead, they are applied in the wild, i.e., on application-dependent text collections different from those used for the tools' training, varying, e.g., in focus, genre, style, and text type. This raises the question of whether the reported performance of BTM tools can be trusted for downstream applications. Here, we report on the results of a carefully designed cross-corpus benchmark for named entity extraction, where tools were applied systematically to corpora not used during their training. Based on a survey of 28 published systems, we selected five for an in-depth analysis on three publicly available corpora encompassing four different entity types. Comparison between tools results in a mixed picture and shows that, in a cross-corpus setting, the performance is significantly lower than the one reported in an in-corpus setting. HunFlair2 showed the best performance on average, being closely followed by PubTator. Our results indicate that users of BTM tools should expect diminishing performances when applying them in the wild compared to original publications and show that further research is necessary to make BTM tools more robust.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:58:18 UTC (4,671 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 13:10:27 UTC (4,671 KB)"
2,Construction of a Syntactic Analysis Map for Yi Shui School through Text Mining and Natural Language Processing Research,"Hanqing Zhao, Yuehan Li",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Entity and relationship extraction is a crucial component in natural language processing tasks such as knowledge graph construction, question answering system design, and semantic analysis. Most of the information of the Yishui school of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is stored in the form of unstructured classical Chinese text. The key information extraction of TCM texts plays an important role in mining and studying the academic schools of TCM. In order to solve these problems efficiently using artificial intelligence methods, this study constructs a word segmentation and entity relationship extraction model based on conditional random fields under the framework of natural language processing technology to identify and extract the entity relationship of traditional Chinese medicine texts, and uses the common weighting technology of TF-IDF information retrieval and data mining to extract important key entity information in different ancient books. The dependency syntactic parser based on neural network is used to analyze the grammatical relationship between entities in each ancient book article, and it is represented as a tree structure visualization, which lays the foundation for the next construction of the knowledge graph of Yishui school and the use of artificial intelligence methods to carry out the research of TCM academic schools.","Fri, 16 Feb 2024 14:59:55 UTC (561 KB)"
3,Multi-Fidelity Methods for Optimization: A Survey,"Ke Li, Fan Li",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Real-world black-box optimization often involves time-consuming or costly experiments and simulations. Multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) stands out as a cost-effective strategy that balances high-fidelity accuracy with computational efficiency through a hierarchical fidelity approach. This survey presents a systematic exploration of MFO, underpinned by a novel text mining framework based on a pre-trained language model. We delve deep into the foundational principles and methodologies of MFO, focusing on three core components -- multi-fidelity surrogate models, fidelity management strategies, and optimization techniques. Additionally, this survey highlights the diverse applications of MFO across several key domains, including machine learning, engineering design optimization, and scientific discovery, showcasing the adaptability and effectiveness of MFO in tackling complex computational challenges. Furthermore, we also envision several emerging challenges and prospects in the MFO landscape, spanning scalability, the composition of lower fidelities, and the integration of human-in-the-loop approaches at the algorithmic level. We also address critical issues related to benchmarking and the advancement of open science within the MFO community. Overall, this survey aims to catalyze further research and foster collaborations in MFO, setting the stage for future innovations and breakthroughs in the field.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:52:34 UTC (35,662 KB)"
4,A step towards the integration of machine learning and small area estimation,"Tomasz Żądło, Adam Chwila",Methodology (stat.ME),"The use of machine-learning techniques has grown in numerous research areas. Currently, it is also widely used in statistics, including the official statistics for data collection (e.g. satellite imagery, web scraping and text mining, data cleaning, integration and imputation) but also for data analysis. However, the usage of these methods in survey sampling including small area estimation is still very limited. Therefore, we propose a predictor supported by these algorithms which can be used to predict any population or subpopulation characteristics based on cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Machine learning methods have already been shown to be very powerful in identifying and modelling complex and nonlinear relationships between the variables, which means that they have very good properties in case of strong departures from the classic assumptions. Therefore, we analyse the performance of our proposal under a different set-up, in our opinion of greater importance in real-life surveys. We study only small departures from the assumed model, to show that our proposal is a good alternative in this case as well, even in comparison with optimal methods under the model. What is more, we propose the method of the accuracy estimation of machine learning predictors, giving the possibility of the accuracy comparison with classic methods, where the accuracy is measured as in survey sampling practice. The solution of this problem is indicated in the literature as one of the key issues in integration of these approaches. The simulation studies are based on a real, longitudinal dataset, freely available from the Polish Local Data Bank, where the prediction problem of subpopulation characteristics in the last period, with ""borrowing strength"" from other subpopulations and time periods, is considered.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 09:43:17 UTC (110 KB)"
5,How to Refactor this Code? An Exploratory Study on Developer-ChatGPT Refactoring Conversations,"Eman Abdullah AlOmar, Anushkrishna Venkatakrishnan, Mohamed Wiem Mkaouer, Christian D. Newman, Ali Ouni",Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have gained widespread popularity and usage in various software engineering tasks, including refactoring, testing, code review, and program comprehension. Despite recent studies delving into refactoring documentation in commit messages, issues, and code review, little is known about how developers articulate their refactoring needs when interacting with ChatGPT. In this paper, our goal is to explore conversations between developers and ChatGPT related to refactoring to better understand how developers identify areas for improvement in code and how ChatGPT addresses developers' needs. Our approach relies on text mining refactoring-related conversations from 17,913 ChatGPT prompts and responses, and investigating developers' explicit refactoring intention. Our results reveal that (1) developer-ChatGPT conversations commonly involve generic and specific terms/phrases; (2) developers often make generic refactoring requests, while ChatGPT typically includes the refactoring intention; and (3) various learning settings when prompting ChatGPT in the context of refactoring. We envision that our findings contribute to a broader understanding of the collaboration between developers and AI models, in the context of code refactoring, with implications for model improvement, tool development, and best practices in software engineering.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 19:24:01 UTC (2,570 KB)"
6,Quantifying Similarity: Text-Mining Approaches to Evaluate ChatGPT and Google Bard Content in Relation to BioMedical Literature,"Jakub Klimczak, Ahmed Abdeen Hamed",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Background: The emergence of generative AI tools, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has shown powerful capabilities in generating content. To date, the assessment of the usefulness of such content, generated by what is known as prompt engineering, has become an interesting research question. Objectives Using the mean of prompt engineering, we assess the similarity and closeness of such contents to real literature produced by scientists. Methods In this exploratory analysis, (1) we prompt-engineer ChatGPT and Google Bard to generate clinical content to be compared with literature counterparts, (2) we assess the similarities of the contents generated by comparing them with counterparts from biomedical literature. Our approach is to use text-mining approaches to compare documents and associated bigrams and to use network analysis to assess the terms' centrality. Results The experiments demonstrated that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in cosine document similarity (38% to 34%), Jaccard document similarity (23% to 19%), TF-IDF bigram similarity (47% to 41%), and term network centrality (degree and closeness). We also found new links that emerged in ChatGPT bigram networks that did not exist in literature bigram networks. Conclusions: The obtained similarity results show that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in document similarity, bigrams, and degree and closeness centrality. We also observed that ChatGPT offers linkage to terms that are connected in the literature. Such connections could inspire asking interesting questions and generate new hypotheses.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 17:14:46 UTC (3,859 KB)[v2] Sun, 11 Feb 2024 22:50:17 UTC (3,857 KB)"
7,"Leveraging Social Media Data to Identify Factors Influencing Public Attitude Towards Accessibility, Socioeconomic Disparity and Public Transportation","Khondhaker Al Momin, Arif Mohaimin Sadri, Md Sami Hasnine",Computers and Society (cs.CY),"This study proposes a novel method to understand the factors affecting individuals' perception of transport accessibility, socioeconomic disparity, and public infrastructure. As opposed to the time consuming and expensive survey-based approach, this method can generate organic large-scale responses from social media and develop statistical models to understand individuals' perceptions of various transportation issues. This study retrieved and analyzed 36,098 tweets from New York City from March 19, 2020, to May 15, 2022. A state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithm is used for text mining and classification. A data fusion technique has been adopted to generate a series of socioeconomic traits that are used as explanatory variables in the model. The model results show that females and individuals of Asian origin tend to discuss transportation accessibility more than their counterparts, with those experiencing high neighborhood traffic also being more vocal. However, disadvantaged individuals, including the unemployed and those living in low-income neighborhoods or in areas with high natural hazard risks, tend to communicate less about such issues. As for socioeconomic disparity, individuals of Asian origin and those experiencing various types of air pollution are more likely to discuss these topics on Twitter, often with a negative sentiment. However, unemployed, or disadvantaged individuals, as well as those living in areas with high natural hazard risks or expected losses, are less inclined to tweet about this subject. Lack of internet accessibility could be a reason why many disadvantaged individuals do not tweet about transport accessibility and subsidized internet could be a possible solution.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 06:51:29 UTC (857 KB)"
8,A Scalable and Automated Framework for Tracking the likely Adoption of Emerging Technologies,"Lowri Williams, Eirini Anthi, Pete Burnap",Computers and Society (cs.CY),"While new technologies are expected to revolutionise and become game-changers in improving the efficiencies and practises of our daily lives, it is also critical to investigate and understand the barriers and opportunities faced by their adopters. Such findings can serve as an additional feature in the decision-making process when analysing the risks, costs, and benefits of adopting an emerging technology in a particular setting. Although several studies have attempted to perform such investigations, these approaches adopt a qualitative data collection methodology which is limited in terms of the size of the targeted participant group and is associated with a significant manual overhead when transcribing and inferring results. This paper presents a scalable and automated framework for tracking likely adoption and/or rejection of new technologies from a large landscape of adopters. In particular, a large corpus of social media texts containing references to emerging technologies was compiled. Text mining techniques were applied to extract sentiments expressed towards technology aspects. In the context of the problem definition herein, we hypothesise that the expression of positive sentiment infers an increase in the likelihood of impacting a technology user's acceptance to adopt, integrate, and/or use the technology, and negative sentiment infers an increase in the likelihood of impacting the rejection of emerging technologies by adopters. To quantitatively test our hypothesis, a ground truth analysis was performed to validate that the sentiment captured by the text mining approach is comparable to the results given by human annotators when asked to label whether such texts positively or negatively impact their outlook towards adopting an emerging technology.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:42:14 UTC (984 KB)"
9,Building Contextual Knowledge Graphs for Personalized Learning Recommendations using Text Mining and Semantic Graph Completion,"Hasan Abu-Rasheed, Mareike Dornhöfer, Christian Weber, Gábor Kismihók, Ulrike Buchmann, Madjid Fathi",Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"Modelling learning objects (LO) within their context enables the learner to advance from a basic, remembering-level, learning objective to a higher-order one, i.e., a level with an application- and analysis objective. While hierarchical data models are commonly used in digital learning platforms, using graph-based models enables representing the context of LOs in those platforms. This leads to a foundation for personalized recommendations of learning paths. In this paper, the transformation of hierarchical data models into knowledge graph (KG) models of LOs using text mining is introduced and evaluated. We utilize custom text mining pipelines to mine semantic relations between elements of an expert-curated hierarchical model. We evaluate the KG structure and relation extraction using graph quality-control metrics and the comparison of algorithmic semantic-similarities to expert-defined ones. The results show that the relations in the KG are semantically comparable to those defined by domain experts, and that the proposed KG improves representing and linking the contexts of LOs through increasing graph communities and betweenness centrality.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:27:08 UTC (4,217 KB)"
10,Topic Modelling: Going Beyond Token Outputs,"Lowri Williams, Eirini Anthi, Laura Arman, Pete Burnap",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Topic modelling is a text mining technique for identifying salient themes from a number of documents. The output is commonly a set of topics consisting of isolated tokens that often co-occur in such documents. Manual effort is often associated with interpreting a topic's description from such tokens. However, from a human's perspective, such outputs may not adequately provide enough information to infer the meaning of the topics; thus, their interpretability is often inaccurately understood. Although several studies have attempted to automatically extend topic descriptions as a means of enhancing the interpretation of topic models, they rely on external language sources that may become unavailable, must be kept up-to-date to generate relevant results, and present privacy issues when training on or processing data. This paper presents a novel approach towards extending the output of traditional topic modelling methods beyond a list of isolated tokens. This approach removes the dependence on external sources by using the textual data itself by extracting high-scoring keywords and mapping them to the topic model's token outputs. To measure the interpretability of the proposed outputs against those of the traditional topic modelling approach, independent annotators manually scored each output based on their quality and usefulness, as well as the efficiency of the annotation task. The proposed approach demonstrated higher quality and usefulness, as well as higher efficiency in the annotation task, in comparison to the outputs of a traditional topic modelling method, demonstrating an increase in their interpretability.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 16:05:54 UTC (7,465 KB)"
11,Examining the Role of Peer Acknowledgements on Social Annotations: Unraveling the Psychological Underpinnings,"Xiaoshan Huang, Haolun Wu, Xue Liu, Susanne Lajoie",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"This study explores the impact of peer acknowledgement on learner engagement and implicit psychological attributes in written annotations on an online social reading platform. Participants included 91 undergraduates from a large North American University. Using log file data, we analyzed the relationship between learners' received peer acknowledgement and their subsequent annotation behaviours using cross-lag regression. Higher peer acknowledgements correlate with increased initiation of annotations and responses to peer annotations. By applying text mining techniques and calculating Shapley values to analyze 1,969 social annotation entries, we identified prominent psychological themes within three dimensions (i.e., affect, cognition, and motivation) that foster peer acknowledgment in digital social annotation. These themes include positive affect, openness to learning and discussion, and expression of motivation. The findings assist educators in improving online learning communities and provide guidance to technology developers in designing effective prompts, drawing from both implicit psychological cues and explicit learning behaviours.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 18:28:07 UTC (1,114 KB)[v2] Thu, 15 Feb 2024 22:08:01 UTC (1,114 KB)"
12,BioFinBERT: Finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to Analyze Sentiment of Press Releases and Financial Text Around Inflection Points of Biotech Stocks,"Valentina Aparicio, Daniel Gordon, Sebastian G. Huayamares, Yuhuai Luo",General Finance (q-fin.GN),"Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning algorithms being used to perform natural language processing tasks in various fields, from social sciences to finance and biomedical sciences. Developing and training a new LLM can be very computationally expensive, so it is becoming a common practice to take existing LLMs and finetune them with carefully curated datasets for desired applications in different fields. Here, we present BioFinBERT, a finetuned LLM to perform financial sentiment analysis of public text associated with stocks of companies in the biotechnology sector. The stocks of biotech companies developing highly innovative and risky therapeutic drugs tend to respond very positively or negatively upon a successful or failed clinical readout or regulatory approval of their drug, respectively. These clinical or regulatory results are disclosed by the biotech companies via press releases, which are followed by a significant stock response in many cases. In our attempt to design a LLM capable of analyzing the sentiment of these press releases,we first finetuned BioBERT, a biomedical language representation model designed for biomedical text mining, using financial textual databases. Our finetuned model, termed BioFinBERT, was then used to perform financial sentiment analysis of various biotech-related press releases and financial text around inflection points that significantly affected the price of biotech stocks.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 20:09:44 UTC (1,300 KB)"
13,Taec: a Manually annotated text dataset for trait and phenotype extraction and entity linking in wheat breeding literature,"Claire Nédellec, Clara Sauvion, Robert Bossy, Mariya Borovikova, Louise Deléger",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Wheat varieties show a large diversity of traits and phenotypes. Linking them to genetic variability is essential for shorter and more efficient wheat breeding programs. Newly desirable wheat variety traits include disease resistance to reduce pesticide use, adaptation to climate change, resistance to heat and drought stresses, or low gluten content of grains. Wheat breeding experiments are documented by a large body of scientific literature and observational data obtained in-field and under controlled conditions. The cross-referencing of complementary information from the literature and observational data is essential to the study of the genotype-phenotype relationship and to the improvement of wheat selection. The scientific literature on genetic marker-assisted selection describes much information about the genotype-phenotype relationship. However, the variety of expressions used to refer to traits and phenotype values in scientific articles is a hinder to finding information and cross-referencing it. When trained adequately by annotated examples, recent text mining methods perform highly in named entity recognition and linking in the scientific domain. While several corpora contain annotations of human and animal phenotypes, currently, no corpus is available for training and evaluating named entity recognition and entity-linking methods in plant phenotype literature. The Triticum aestivum trait Corpus is a new gold standard for traits and phenotypes of wheat. It consists of 540 PubMed references fully annotated for trait, phenotype, and species named entities using the Wheat Trait and Phenotype Ontology and the species taxonomy of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A study of the performance of tools trained on the Triticum aestivum trait Corpus shows that the corpus is suitable for the training and evaluation of named entity recognition and linking.","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 03:23:24 UTC (431 KB)"
14,Two Directions for Clinical Data Generation with Large Language Models: Data-to-Label and Label-to-Data,"Rumeng Li, Xun Wang, Hong Yu",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Large language models (LLMs) can generate natural language texts for various domains and tasks, but their potential for clinical text mining, a domain with scarce, sensitive, and imbalanced medical data, is underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can augment clinical data for detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related signs and symptoms from electronic health records (EHRs), a challenging task that requires high expertise. We create a novel pragmatic taxonomy for AD sign and symptom progression based on expert knowledge, which guides LLMs to generate synthetic data following two different directions: ""data-to-label"", which labels sentences from a public EHR collection with AD-related signs and symptoms; and ""label-to-data"", which generates sentences with AD-related signs and symptoms based on the label definition. We train a system to detect AD-related signs and symptoms from EHRs, using three datasets: (1) a gold dataset annotated by human experts on longitudinal EHRs of AD patients; (2) a silver dataset created by the data-to-label method; and (3) a bronze dataset created by the label-to-data method. We find that using the silver and bronze datasets improves the system performance, outperforming the system using only the gold dataset. This shows that LLMs can generate synthetic clinical data for a complex task by incorporating expert knowledge, and our label-to-data method can produce datasets that are free of sensitive information, while maintaining acceptable quality.","Sat, 9 Dec 2023 19:35:40 UTC (841 KB)"
15,Exact representation and efficient approximations of linear model predictive control laws via HardTanh type deep neural networks,"Daniela Lupu, Ion Necoara",Optimization and Control (math.OC),"Deep neural networks have revolutionized many fields, including image processing, inverse problems, text mining and more recently, give very promising results in systems and control. Neural networks with hidden layers have a strong potential as an approximation framework of predictive control laws as they usually yield better approximation quality and smaller memory requirements than existing explicit (multi-parametric) approaches. In this paper, we first show that neural networks with HardTanh activation functions can exactly represent predictive control laws of linear time-invariant systems. We derive theoretical bounds on the minimum number of hidden layers and neurons that a HardTanh neural network should have to exactly represent a given predictive control law. The choice of HardTanh deep neural networks is particularly suited for linear predictive control laws as they usually require less hidden layers and neurons than deep neural networks with ReLU units for representing exactly continuous piecewise affine (or equivalently min-max) maps. In the second part of the paper we bring the physics of the model and standard optimization techniques into the architecture design, in order to eliminate the disadvantages of the black-box HardTanh learning. More specifically, we design trainable unfolded HardTanh deep architectures for learning linear predictive control laws based on two standard iterative optimization algorithms, i.e., projected gradient descent and accelerated projected gradient descent. We also study the performance of the proposed HardTanh type deep neural networks on a linear model predictive control application.","Wed, 10 Jan 2024 11:19:20 UTC (219 KB)"
16,IDoFew: Intermediate Training Using Dual-Clustering in Language Models for Few Labels Text Classification,"Abdullah Alsuhaibani, Hamad Zogan, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel, Guandong Xu",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been very effective in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining tasks including text classification. However, some tasks still pose challenges for these models, including text classification with limited labels. This can result in a cold-start problem. Although some approaches have attempted to address this problem through single-stage clustering as an intermediate training step coupled with a pre-trained language model, which generates pseudo-labels to improve classification, these methods are often error-prone due to the limitations of the clustering algorithms. To overcome this, we have developed a novel two-stage intermediate clustering with subsequent fine-tuning that models the pseudo-labels reliably, resulting in reduced prediction errors. The key novelty in our model, IDoFew, is that the two-stage clustering coupled with two different clustering algorithms helps exploit the advantages of the complementary algorithms that reduce the errors in generating reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. Our approach has shown significant improvements compared to strong comparative models.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 17:07:37 UTC (1,405 KB)"

18,Language Model as an Annotator: Unsupervised Context-aware Quality Phrase Generation,"Zhihao Zhang, Yuan Zuo, Chenghua Lin, Junjie Wu",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Phrase mining is a fundamental text mining task that aims to identify quality phrases from context. Nevertheless, the scarcity of extensive gold labels datasets, demanding substantial annotation efforts from experts, renders this task exceptionally challenging. Furthermore, the emerging, infrequent, and domain-specific nature of quality phrases presents further challenges in dealing with this task. In this paper, we propose LMPhrase, a novel unsupervised context-aware quality phrase mining framework built upon large pre-trained language models (LMs). Specifically, we first mine quality phrases as silver labels by employing a parameter-free probing technique called Perturbed Masking on the pre-trained language model BERT (coined as Annotator). In contrast to typical statistic-based or distantly-supervised methods, our silver labels, derived from large pre-trained language models, take into account rich contextual information contained in the LMs. As a result, they bring distinct advantages in preserving informativeness, concordance, and completeness of quality phrases. Secondly, training a discriminative span prediction model heavily relies on massive annotated data and is likely to face the risk of overfitting silver labels. Alternatively, we formalize phrase tagging task as the sequence generation problem by directly fine-tuning on the Sequence-to-Sequence pre-trained language model BART with silver labels (coined as Generator). Finally, we merge the quality phrases from both the Annotator and Generator as the final predictions, considering their complementary nature and distinct characteristics. Extensive experiments show that our LMPhrase consistently outperforms all the existing competitors across two different granularity phrase mining tasks, where each task is tested on two different domain datasets.","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 20:32:44 UTC (1,165 KB)"
19,Efficient High-Quality Clustering for Large Bipartite Graphs,"Renchi Yang, Jieming Shi",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),"A bipartite graph contains inter-set edges between two disjoint vertex sets, and is widely used to model real-world data, such as user-item purchase records, author-article publications, and biological interactions between drugs and proteins. k-Bipartite Graph Clustering (k-BGC) is to partition the target vertex set in a bipartite graph into k disjoint clusters. The clustering quality is important to the utility of k-BGC in various applications like social network analysis, recommendation systems, text mining, and bioinformatics, to name a few. Existing approaches to k-BGC either output clustering results with compromised quality due to inadequate exploitation of high-order information between vertices, or fail to handle sizable bipartite graphs with billions of edges. Motivated by this, this paper presents two efficient k-BGC solutions, HOPE and HOPE+, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale bipartite graphs. HOPE obtains high scalability and effectiveness through a new k-BGC problem formulation based on the novel notion of high-order perspective (HOP) vectors and an efficient technique for low-rank approximation of HOP vectors. HOPE+ further elevates the k-BGC performance to another level with a judicious problem transformation and a highly efficient two-stage optimization framework. Two variants, HOPE+ (FNEM) and HOPE+ (SNEM) are designed when either the Frobenius norm or spectral norm is applied in the transformation. Extensive experiments, comparing HOPE and HOPE+ against 13 competitors on 10 real-world datasets, exhibit that our solutions, especially HOPE+, are superior to existing methods in terms of result quality, while being up to orders of magnitude faster. On the largest dataset MAG with 1.1 billion edges, HOPE+ is able to produce clusters with the highest clustering accuracy within 31 minutes, which is unmatched by any existing solution for k-BGC.","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 09:50:56 UTC (990 KB)"
20,Debiasing Sample Loadings and Scores in Exponential Family PCA for Sparse Count Data,"Ruochen Huang, Yoonkyung Lee",Methodology (stat.ME),"Multivariate count data with many zeros frequently occur in a variety of application areas such as text mining with a document-term matrix and cluster analysis with microbiome abundance data. Exponential family PCA (Collins et al., 2001) is a widely used dimension reduction tool to understand and capture the underlying low-rank structure of count data. It produces principal component scores by fitting Poisson regression models with estimated loadings as covariates. This tends to result in extreme scores for sparse count data significantly deviating from true scores. We consider two major sources of bias in this estimation procedure and propose ways to reduce their effects. First, the discrepancy between true loadings and their estimates under a limited sample size largely degrades the quality of score estimates. By treating estimated loadings as covariates with bias and measurement errors, we debias score estimates, using the iterative bootstrap method for loadings and considering classical measurement error models. Second, the existence of MLE bias is often ignored in score estimation, but this bias could be removed through well-known MLE bias reduction methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bias correction procedure through experiments on both simulated data and real data.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 21:16:07 UTC (855 KB)"

Using a dedicated text-mining pipeline, we extract both long and short-form descriptions covering a wide range of topics related to music content such as genre, style, mood, instrumentation, and tempo. To show the use of this data, we train a model that jointly learns text and audio representations and performs cross-modal retrieval. The model is evaluated on two tasks: tag-based music retrieval and music auto-tagging. The results show that while our approach has state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks, but still observe a difference in performance depending on the data used for training.","Thu, 14 Dec 2023 18:38:02 UTC (108 KB)"

25,Insights into Classifying and Mitigating LLMs' Hallucinations,"Alessandro Bruno, Pier Luigi Mazzeo, Aladine Chetouani, Marouane Tliba, Mohamed Amine Kerkouri",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across diverse AI applications is proof of the outstanding achievements obtained in several tasks, such as text mining, text generation, and question answering. However, LLMs are not exempt from drawbacks. One of the most concerning aspects regards the emerging problematic phenomena known as ""Hallucinations"". They manifest in text generation systems, particularly in question-answering systems reliant on LLMs, potentially resulting in false or misleading information propagation. This paper delves into the underlying causes of AI hallucination and elucidates its significance in artificial intelligence. In particular, Hallucination classification is tackled over several tasks (Machine Translation, Question and Answer, Dialog Systems, Summarisation Systems, Knowledge Graph with LLMs, and Visual Question Answer). Additionally, we explore potential strategies to mitigate hallucinations, aiming to enhance the overall reliability of LLMs. Our research addresses this critical issue within the HeReFaNMi (Health-Related Fake News Mitigation) project, generously supported by NGI Search, dedicated to combating Health-Related Fake News dissemination on the Internet. This endeavour represents a concerted effort to safeguard the integrity of information dissemination in an age of evolving AI technologies.","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 12:30:28 UTC (476 KB)"
26,BIDRN: A Method of Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis,"Dr. D Muthusankar, Dr. P Kaladevi, Dr. V R Sadasivam, R Praveen",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Text mining research has grown in importance in recent years due to the tremendous increase in the volume of unstructured textual data. This has resulted in immense potential as well as obstacles in the sector, which may be efficiently addressed with adequate analytical and study methods. Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks are used in this study to analyze sentiment. The method is categorized as sentiment polarity analysis because it may generate a dataset with sentiment labels. This dataset can be used to train and evaluate sentiment analysis models capable of extracting impartial opinions. This paper describes the Sentiment Analysis-Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (SA-BDRNN) Scheme, which seeks to overcome the challenges and maximize the potential of text mining in the context of Big Data. The current study proposes a SA-DBRNN Scheme that attempts to give a systematic framework for sentiment analysis in the context of student input on institution choice. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed SA- DBRNN Scheme to existing frameworks to establish a robust deep neural network that might serve as an adequate classification model in the field of sentiment analysis.","Mon, 13 Nov 2023 12:36:53 UTC (502 KB)"

Byers, Dan Gunter, Kjiersten Fagnan, Lavanya Ramakrishnan",Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"Advanced omics technologies and facilities generate a wealth of valuable data daily; however, the data often lacks the essential metadata required for researchers to find and search them effectively. The lack of metadata poses a significant challenge in the utilization of these datasets. Machine learning-based metadata extraction techniques have emerged as a potentially viable approach to automatically annotating scientific datasets with the metadata necessary for enabling effective search. Text labeling, usually performed manually, plays a crucial role in validating machine-extracted metadata. However, manual labeling is time-consuming; thus, there is an need to develop automated text labeling techniques in order to accelerate the process of scientific innovation. This need is particularly urgent in fields such as environmental genomics and microbiome science, which have historically received less attention in terms of metadata curation and creation of gold-standard text mining datasets. In this paper, we present two novel automated text labeling approaches for the validation of ML-generated metadata for unlabeled texts, with specific applications in environmental genomics. Our techniques show the potential of two new ways to leverage existing information about the unlabeled texts and the scientific domain. The first technique exploits relationships between different types of data sources related to the same research study, such as publications and proposals. The second technique takes advantage of domain-specific controlled vocabularies or ontologies. In this paper, we detail applying these approaches for ML-generated metadata validation. Our results show that the proposed label assignment approaches can generate both generic and highly-specific text labels for the unlabeled texts, with up to 44% of the labels matching with those suggested by a ML keyword extraction algorithm.","Wed, 8 Nov 2023 22:09:31 UTC (788 KB)"
29,In nomine patris... Elements for a semantics of medieval paternity,Nicolas Perreaux (LAMOP),Digital Libraries (cs.DL),"This article examines medieval concepts of paternity and father-son relationships through the digital analysis of medieval textual corpora. Although historians have access to enormous digital collections in 2023, they have rarely fully exploited these resources. The author proposes a historical semantic approach to this theme, using modeling tools and text mining in general, to analyze the evolution of terms related to paternity. The study proposes three conclusions: 1. a semantic break occurred in the semantic field of paternity at the turn of Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. The meaning of pater and its derivatives changed radically over the course of the 4th-6th centuries, particularly as a result of the influence of the dogma of the Christian Trinity. Medieval fatherhood was multidimensional, encompassing both biological and spiritual aspects, in other words, complex relationships between multiple carnal and spiritual (i.e. divine) fathers. 2. The role of spiritual kinship is crucial to understanding medieval fatherhood, as the work of Anita Guerreau-Jalabert and J{é}r{ô}me Baschet has already shown. Initially attributed to God, this ''ideal paternity'' (paternitas) gradually extended to members of the Church (popes, bishops, abbots), underlining at the same time the growing importance of spiritual kinship over biological kinship over the centuries studied. 3. To reveal these structures, invisible to the naked eye, an interdisciplinary approach is rigorously required. Complementary investigations into the lemmas mater, filia, frater and other family terms are required. The use of digital tools and historical semantic analysis opens up new perspectives for researchers in history, anthropology, linguistics and data mining, enabling them to explore the representation systems of ancient societies in depth and with nuance.","Fri, 6 Oct 2023 09:10:58 UTC (1,674 KB)"

However, ICL requires high-quality annotated demonstrations which might not be available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{D}ata \textbf{A}ugmentation for \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{DAIL}). DAIL leverages the intuition that large language models are more familiar with the content generated by themselves. It first utilizes the language model to generate paraphrases of the test sample and employs majority voting to determine the final result based on individual predictions. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that DAIL outperforms the standard ICL method and other ensemble-based methods in the low-resource scenario. Additionally, we explore the use of voting consistency as a confidence score of the model when the logits of predictions are inaccessible. We believe our work will stimulate further research on ICL in low-resource settings.","Mon, 6 Nov 2023 18:12:55 UTC (1,377 KB)"
31,Content Significance Distribution of Sub-Text Blocks in Articles and Its Application to Article-Organization Assessment,"You Zhou, Jie Wang",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"We explore how to capture the significance of a sub-text block in an article and how it may be used for text mining tasks. A sub-text block is a sub-sequence of sentences in the article. We formulate the notion of content significance distribution (CSD) of sub-text blocks, referred to as CSD of the first kind and denoted by CSD-1. In particular, we leverage Hugging Face's SentenceTransformer to generate contextual sentence embeddings, and use MoverScore over text embeddings to measure how similar a sub-text block is to the entire text. To overcome the exponential blowup on the number of sub-text blocks, we present an approximation algorithm and show that the approximated CSD-1 is almost identical to the exact CSD-1. Under this approximation, we show that the average and median CSD-1's for news, scholarly research, argument, and narrative articles share the same pattern. We also show that under a certain linear transformation, the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution with certain values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ resembles a CSD-1 curve. We then use CSD-1's to extract linguistic features to train an SVC classifier for assessing how well an article is organized. Through experiments, we show that this method achieves high accuracy for assessing student essays. Moreover, we study CSD of sentence locations, referred to as CSD of the second kind and denoted by CSD-2, and show that average CSD-2's for different types of articles possess distinctive patterns, which either conform common perceptions of article structures or provide rectification with minor deviation.","Fri, 3 Nov 2023 02:43:51 UTC (6,555 KB)"

However, in the race for the best performing model, many important aspects are often overlooked when, on the contrary, they should be carefully considered. In fact, sometimes the gaps in performance between different approaches are neglectable, whereas factors such as production costs, energy consumption, and carbon footprint must take into consideration. Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively adopted to address NLP problems in academia and industry. In this work, we present a detailed quantitative comparison of LLM and traditional approaches (e.g. SVM) on the LexGLUE benchmark, which takes into account both performance (standard indices) and alternative metrics such as timing, power consumption and cost, in a word: the carbon-footprint. In our analysis, we considered the prototyping phase (model selection by training-validation-test iterations) and in-production phases separately, since they follow different implementation procedures and also require different resources. The results indicate that very often, the simplest algorithms achieve performance very close to that of large LLMs but with very low power consumption and lower resource demands. The results obtained could suggest companies to include additional evaluations in the choice of Machine Learning (ML) solutions.","Thu, 2 Nov 2023 14:16:48 UTC (565 KB)[v2] Mon, 5 Feb 2024 11:13:59 UTC (759 KB)"
33,Sentence Bag Graph Formulation for Biomedical Distant Supervision Relation Extraction,"Hao Zhang, Yang Liu, Xiaoyan Liu, Tianming Liang, Gaurav Sharma, Liang Xue, Maozu Guo",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"We introduce a novel graph-based framework for alleviating key challenges in distantly-supervised relation extraction and demonstrate its effectiveness in the challenging and important domain of biomedical data. Specifically, we propose a graph view of sentence bags referring to an entity pair, which enables message-passing based aggregation of information related to the entity pair over the sentence bag. The proposed framework alleviates the common problem of noisy labeling in distantly supervised relation extraction and also effectively incorporates inter-dependencies between sentences within a bag. Extensive experiments on two large-scale biomedical relation datasets and the widely utilized NYT dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for biomedical distant supervision relation extraction while also providing excellent performance for relation extraction in the general text mining domain.","Sun, 29 Oct 2023 05:48:04 UTC (2,168 KB)"
34,Test-time Augmentation for Factual Probing,"Go Kamoda, Benjamin Heinzerling, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Factual probing is a method that uses prompts to test if a language model ""knows"" certain world knowledge facts. A problem in factual probing is that small changes to the prompt can lead to large changes in model output. Previous work aimed to alleviate this problem by optimizing prompts via text mining or fine-tuning. However, such approaches are relation-specific and do not generalize to unseen relation types. Here, we propose to use test-time augmentation (TTA) as a relation-agnostic method for reducing sensitivity to prompt variations by automatically augmenting and ensembling prompts at test time. Experiments show improved model calibration, i.e., with TTA, model confidence better reflects prediction accuracy. Improvements in prediction accuracy are observed for some models, but for other models, TTA leads to degradation. Error analysis identifies the difficulty of producing high-quality prompt variations as the main challenge for TTA.","Thu, 26 Oct 2023 03:41:32 UTC (114 KB)"

38,ForeSeer: Product Aspect Forecasting Using Temporal Graph Embedding,"Zixuan Liu, Gaurush Hiranandani, Kun Qian, Eddie W. Huang, Yi Xu, Belinda Zeng, Karthik Subbian, Sheng Wang",Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"Developing text mining approaches to mine aspects from customer reviews has been well-studied due to its importance in understanding customer needs and product attributes. In contrast, it remains unclear how to predict the future emerging aspects of a new product that currently has little review information. This task, which we named product aspect forecasting, is critical for recommending new products, but also challenging because of the missing reviews. Here, we propose ForeSeer, a novel textual mining and product embedding approach progressively trained on temporal product graphs for this novel product aspect forecasting task. ForeSeer transfers reviews from similar products on a large product graph and exploits these reviews to predict aspects that might emerge in future reviews. A key novelty of our method is to jointly provide review, product, and aspect embeddings that are both time-sensitive and less affected by extremely imbalanced aspect frequencies. We evaluated ForeSeer on a real-world product review system containing 11,536,382 reviews and 11,000 products over 3 years. We observe that ForeSeer substantially outperformed existing approaches with at least 49.1\% AUPRC improvement under the real setting where aspect associations are not given. ForeSeer further improves future link prediction on the product graph and the review aspect association prediction. Collectively, Foreseer offers a novel framework for review forecasting by effectively integrating review text, product network, and temporal information, opening up new avenues for online shopping recommendation and e-commerce applications.","Sat, 7 Oct 2023 16:21:04 UTC (6,787 KB)"

Text mining tools and methods represents automatic approaches for extracting hidden patterns and trends from this semi structured and unstructured data. In Biomedical Text mining, Literature Based Discovery (LBD) is the process of automatically discovering novel associations between medical terms otherwise mentioned in disjoint literature sets. LBD approaches proven to be successfully reducing the discovery time of potential associations that are hidden in the vast amount of scientific literature. The process focuses on creating concept profiles for medical terms such as a disease or symptom and connecting it with a drug and treatment based on the statistical significance of the shared profiles. This knowledge discovery approach introduced in 1989 still remains as a core task in text mining. Currently the ABC principle based two approaches namely open discovery and closed discovery are mostly explored in LBD process. This review starts with general introduction about text mining followed by biomedical text mining and introduces various literature resources such as MEDLINE, UMLS, MESH, and SemMedDB.

This contribution proposes a systematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise, machine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to transparency and replicability. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased as proof of concept. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical semantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference and text mining, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre composition in literature and film; social network inference, automated lexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural analytics. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM applicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving smaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In all but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, generative LLMs can demonstrably serve as viable research instruments. LLM (and human) annotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and should be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping approach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how tasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex computational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in a fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace, but to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in sight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have arguably never been more critical.","Sun, 24 Sep 2023 14:21:50 UTC (5,380 KB)"

Current relation classification models employ additional procedures to identify multiple relations in a single sentence. Furthermore, they overlook the imbalanced predictions pattern. The pattern arises from the presence of a few valid relations that need positive labeling in a relatively large predefined relations set. We propose a multiple relations classification model that tackles these issues through a customized output architecture and by exploiting additional input features. Our findings suggest that handling the imbalanced predictions leads to significant improvements, even on a modest training design. The results demonstrate superiority performance on benchmark datasets commonly used in relation classification.

The model will be the hybrid of two modules. The first module interprets the relevant abbreviatory elements embedded in NSC reports by referring to a comprehensive database that we have made of nearly 950 abbreviations for degree titles used by American postsecondary educators. The second module is a combination of feature classification and text mining modeled with CNN-BiLSTM, which is preceded by several steps of heavy pre-processing. The model proposed in this paper was trained with four multi-label datasets of different grades of resolution and returned 97.83\% accuracy with the most sophisticated dataset. Such a thorough classification of degree levels will provide insights into the modeling patterns of student success and mobility.

Specifically, the objective is to identify topics exhibiting distinct associations with significant results for an outcome of interest by ranking them according to their proportional occurrence in (and consistency of distribution across) reports of significant effects. The proposed method was tested on broad-scope studies addressing whether supplemental nutritional compounds significantly benefit macular degeneration (MD). Four of these were further supported in terms of effectiveness upon conducting a follow-up literature search for validation (omega-3 fatty acids, copper, zeaxanthin, and nitrates). The two not supported by the follow-up literature search (niacin and molybdenum) also had scores in the lowest range under the proposed scoring system, suggesting that the proposed methods score for a given topic may be a viable proxy for its degree of association with the outcome of interest and can be helpful in the search for potentially causal relationships. These results underpin the proposed methods potential to add specificity in understanding effects from broad-scope reports, elucidate topics of interest for future research, and guide evidence synthesis in a systematic and scalable way. All of this is accomplished while yielding valuable insights into the prevention of MD.","Fri, 1 Sep 2023 07:53:28 UTC (657 KB)[v2] Fri, 3 Nov 2023 21:08:54 UTC (506 KB)[v3] Sun, 12 Nov 2023 03:53:50 UTC (978 KB)[v4] Fri, 17 Nov 2023 06:32:49 UTC (5,989 KB)"
49,Biomedical Entity Linking with Triple-aware Pre-Training,"Xi Yan, Cedric Möller, Ricardo Usbeck",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Linking biomedical entities is an essential aspect in biomedical natural language processing tasks, such as text mining and question answering. However, a difficulty of linking the biomedical entities using current large language models (LLM) trained on a general corpus is that biomedical entities are scarcely distributed in texts and therefore have been rarely seen during training by the LLM. At the same time, those LLMs are not aware of high level semantic connection between different biomedical entities, which are useful in identifying similar concepts in different textual contexts. To cope with aforementioned problems, some recent works focused on injecting knowledge graph information into LLMs. However, former methods either ignore the relational knowledge of the entities or lead to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to pre-train the powerful generative LLM by a corpus synthesized from a KG. In the evaluations we are unable to confirm the benefit of including synonym, description or relational information.","Mon, 28 Aug 2023 09:06:28 UTC (121 KB)"

Rafi-Ur-Rashid, Sami Azam, Mirjam Jonkman",Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"The selection of features for text classification is a fundamental task in text mining and information retrieval. Despite being the sixth most widely spoken language in the world, Bangla has received little attention due to the scarcity of text datasets. In this research, we collected, annotated, and prepared a comprehensive dataset of 212,184 Bangla documents in seven different categories and made it publicly accessible. We implemented three deep learning generative models: LSTM variational autoencoder (LSTM VAE), auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN), and adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to extract text features, although their applications are initially found in the field of computer vision. We utilized our dataset to train these three models and used the feature space obtained in the document classification task. We evaluated the performance of the classifiers and found that the adversarial autoencoder model produced the best feature space.","Mon, 21 Aug 2023 22:18:09 UTC (3,444 KB)"

52,BELB: a Biomedical Entity Linking Benchmark,"Samuele Garda, Leon Weber-Genzel, Robert Martin, Ulf Leser",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Biomedical entity linking (BEL) is the task of grounding entity mentions to a knowledge base. It plays a vital role in information extraction pipelines for the life sciences literature. We review recent work in the field and find that, as the task is absent from existing benchmarks for biomedical text mining, different studies adopt different experimental setups making comparisons based on published numbers problematic. Furthermore, neural systems are tested primarily on instances linked to the broad coverage knowledge base UMLS, leaving their performance to more specialized ones, e.g. genes or variants, understudied. We therefore developed BELB, a Biomedical Entity Linking Benchmark, providing access in a unified format to 11 corpora linked to 7 knowledge bases and spanning six entity types: gene, disease, chemical, species, cell line and variant. BELB greatly reduces preprocessing overhead in testing BEL systems on multiple corpora offering a standardized testbed for reproducible experiments. Using BELB we perform an extensive evaluation of six rule-based entity-specific systems and three recent neural approaches leveraging pre-trained language models. Our results reveal a mixed picture showing that neural approaches fail to perform consistently across entity types, highlighting the need of further studies towards entity-agnostic models.","Tue, 22 Aug 2023 16:05:18 UTC (376 KB)"
53,Economic Policy Uncertainty: A Review on Applications and Measurement Methods with Focus on Text Mining Methods,"Fatemeh Kaveh-Yazdy, Sajjad Zarifzadeh",Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) represents the uncertainty realized by the investors during economic policy alterations. EPU is a critical indicator in economic studies to predict future investments, the unemployment rate, and recessions. EPU values can be estimated based on financial parameters directly or implied uncertainty indirectly using the text mining methods. Although EPU is a well-studied topic within the economy, the methods utilized to measure it are understudied. In this article, we define the EPU briefly and review the methods used to measure the EPU, and survey the areas influenced by the changes in EPU level. We divide the EPU measurement methods into three major groups with respect to their input data. Examples of each group of methods are enlisted, and the pros and cons of the groups are discussed. Among the EPU measures, text mining-based ones are dominantly studied. These methods measure the realized uncertainty by taking into account the uncertainty represented in the news and publicly available sources of financial information. Finally, we survey the research areas that rely on measuring the EPU index with the hope that studying the impacts of uncertainty would attract further attention of researchers from various research fields. In addition, we propose a list of future research approaches focusing on measuring EPU using textual material.","Sun, 20 Aug 2023 16:00:53 UTC (993 KB)"

However, the traditional traversal algorithm for constructing co-occurrence networks has high time complexity and space complexity when dealing with large-scale text data. In this paper, we propose an optimized algorithm based on inverted indexing and breadth-first search to improve the efficiency of co-occurrence network construction and reduce memory consumption. Firstly, the traditional traversal algorithm is analyzed, and its performance issues in constructing co-occurrence networks are identified. Then, the detailed implementation process of the optimized algorithm is presented. Subsequently, the CSL large-scale Chinese scientific literature dataset is used for experimental validation, comparing the performance of the traditional traversal algorithm and the optimized algorithm in terms of running time and memory usage. Finally, using non-parametric test methods, the optimized algorithm is proven to have significantly better performance than the traditional traversal algorithm.

55,BI-LAVA: Biocuration with Hierarchical Image Labeling through Active Learning and Visual Analysis,"Juan Trelles, Andrew Wentzel, William Berrios, G. Elisabeta Marai",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"In the biomedical domain, taxonomies organize the acquisition modalities of scientific images in hierarchical structures. Such taxonomies leverage large sets of correct image labels and provide essential information about the importance of a scientific publication, which could then be used in biocuration tasks. However, the hierarchical nature of the labels, the overhead of processing images, the absence or incompleteness of labeled data, and the expertise required to label this type of data impede the creation of useful datasets for biocuration. From a multi-year collaboration with biocurators and text-mining researchers, we derive an iterative visual analytics and active learning strategy to address these challenges. We implement this strategy in a system called BI-LAVA Biocuration with Hierarchical Image Labeling through Active Learning and Visual Analysis. BI-LAVA leverages a small set of image labels, a hierarchical set of image classifiers, and active learning to help model builders deal with incomplete ground-truth labels, target a hierarchical taxonomy of image modalities, and classify a large pool of unlabeled images. BI-LAVA's front end uses custom encodings to represent data distributions, taxonomies, image projections, and neighborhoods of image thumbnails, which help model builders explore an unfamiliar image dataset and taxonomy and correct and generate labels. An evaluation with machine learning practitioners shows that our mixed human-machine approach successfully supports domain experts in understanding the characteristics of classes within the taxonomy, as well as validating and improving data quality in labeled and unlabeled collections.","Tue, 15 Aug 2023 19:36:19 UTC (2,735 KB)"

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a data mining technique that splits data matrices by imposing restrictions on the elements' non-negativity into two matrices: one representing the data partitions and the other to represent the cluster prototypes of the data set. This method has attracted a lot of attention and is used in a wide range of applications, including text mining, clustering, language modeling, music transcription, and neuroscience (gene separation). The interpretation of the generated matrices is made simpler by the absence of negative values. In this article, we propose a study on multi-modal clustering algorithms and present a novel method called multi-modal multi-view non-negative matrix factorization, in which we analyze the collaboration of several local NMF models.

How do these effects transmit through the technology space? This paper answers these two key questions using novel methods of text mining and network analysis. We examine technological interdependence across sectors over a period of half a century (from 1976 to 2021) by analyzing the text of 6.5 million patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and applying network analysis to uncover the full spectrum of linkages existing across technology areas. We demonstrate that patent text contains a wealth of information often not captured by traditional innovation metrics, such as patent citations. By using network analysis, we document that indirect linkages are as important as direct connections and that the former would remain mostly hidden using more traditional measures of indirect linkages, such as the Leontief inverse matrix.

64,Exploring acceptance of autonomous vehicle policies using KeyBERT and SNA: Targeting engineering students,"Jinwoo Ha, Dongsoo Kim",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),"This study aims to explore user acceptance of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) policies with improved text-mining methods. Recently, South Korean policymakers have viewed Autonomous Driving Car (ADC) and Autonomous Driving Robot (ADR) as next-generation means of transportation that will reduce the cost of transporting passengers and goods. They support the construction of V2I and V2V communication infrastructures for ADC and recognize that ADR is equivalent to pedestrians to promote its deployment into sidewalks. To fill the gap where end-user acceptance of these policies is not well considered, this study applied two text-mining methods to the comments of graduate students in the fields of Industrial, Mechanical, and Electronics-Electrical-Computer. One is the Co-occurrence Network Analysis (CNA) based on TF-IWF and Dice coefficient, and the other is the Contextual Semantic Network Analysis (C-SNA) based on both KeyBERT, which extracts keywords that contextually represent the comments, and double cosine similarity. The reason for comparing these approaches is to balance interest not only in the implications for the AV policies but also in the need to apply quality text mining to this research domain. Significantly, the limitation of frequency-based text mining, which does not reflect textual context, and the trade-off of adjusting thresholds in Semantic Network Analysis (SNA) were considered. As the results of comparing the two approaches, the C-SNA provided the information necessary to understand users' voices using fewer nodes and features than the CNA. The users who pre-emptively understood the AV policies based on their engineering literacy and the given texts revealed potential risks of the AV accident policies. This study adds suggestions to manage these risks to support the successful deployment of AVs on public roads.","Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:03:29 UTC (2,357 KB)"

However, the scarcity of open data sources is a continuous challenge for built environment researchers and practitioners. Although several efforts have been made to consolidate existing open datasets, no database currently offers a comprehensive collection of building data types with all subcategories and time granularities (e.g., year, month, and sub-hour). This paper presents the Building Data Genome Directory, an open data-sharing platform serving as a one-stop shop for the data necessary for vital categories of building energy research. The data directory is an online portal (this http URL) that allows filtering and discovering valuable datasets. The directory covers meter, building-level, and aggregated community-level data at the spatial scale and year-to-minute level at the temporal scale. The datasets were consolidated from a comprehensive exploration of sources, including governments, research institutes, and online energy dashboards. The results of this effort include the aggregation of 60 datasets pertaining to building energy ontologies, building energy models, building energy and water data, electric vehicle data, weather data, building information data, text-mining-based research data, image data of buildings, fault detection diagnosis data and occupant data.

Heuristic-based searching and data-driven learning are two main stream implementation approaches. However, no much attention has been paid to document genre and length influence on IE tasks. To fill the gap, in this study, we investigated the accuracy and generalization abilities of heuristic-based searching and data-driven to perform two IE tasks: named entity recognition (NER) and semantic role labeling (SRL) on domain-specific and generic documents with different length. We posited two hypotheses: first, short documents may yield better accuracy results compared to long documents; second, generic documents may exhibit superior extraction outcomes relative to domain-dependent documents due to training document genre limitations. Our findings reveals that no single method demonstrated overwhelming performance in both tasks. For named entity extraction, data-driven approaches outperformed symbolic methods in terms of accuracy, particularly in short texts. In the case of semantic roles extraction, we observed that heuristic-based searching method and data-driven based model with syntax representation surpassed the performance of pure data-driven approach which only consider semantic information. Additionally, we discovered that different semantic roles exhibited varying accuracy levels with the same method. This study offers valuable insights for downstream text mining tasks, such as NER and SRL, when addressing various document features and genres.","Fri, 30 Jun 2023 20:43:27 UTC (1,434 KB)"

Our approach involves the development of a workflow implementing three different processes for text mining, programmed by ChatGPT itself. All of them enable parsing, searching, filtering, classification, summarization, and data unification with different tradeoffs between labor, speed, and accuracy. We deploy this system to extract 26,257 distinct synthesis parameters pertaining to approximately 800 MOFs sourced from peer-reviewed research articles.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.","Mon, 12 Jun 2023 03:28:33 UTC (7,764 KB)"

Moreover, we collected and leveraged three external independent datasets to implement an effective multicenter model, with overall F1-score 84.77%, Precision 83.16%, Recall 86.44%. The lessons learned are: (i) the crucial role of a consistent annotation process and (ii) a fine-tuning strategy that combines classical methods with a ""low-resource"" approach. This allowed us to establish methodological guidelines that pave the way for Natural Language Processing studies in less-resourced languages.","Thu, 8 Jun 2023 16:15:46 UTC (587 KB)[v2] Mon, 15 Jan 2024 11:05:23 UTC (1,063 KB)"
74,Analysis of the Fed's communication by using textual entailment model of Zero-Shot classification,"Yasuhiro Nakayama, Tomochika Sawaki",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"In this study, we analyze documents published by central banks using text mining techniques and propose a method to evaluate the policy tone of central banks. Since the monetary policies of major central banks have a broad impact on financial market trends, the pricing of risky assets, and the real economy, market participants are attempting to more accurately capture changes in the outlook for central banks' future monetary policies. Since the published documents are also an important tool for the central bank to communicate with the market, they are meticulously elaborated on grammatical syntax and wording, and investors are urged to read more accurately about the central bank's policy stance. Sentiment analysis on central bank documents has long been carried out, but it has been difficult to interpret the meaning of the documents accurately and to explicitly capture even the intentional change in nuance. This study attempts to evaluate the implication of the zero-shot text classification method for an unknown economic environment using the same model. We compare the tone of the statements, minutes, press conference transcripts of FOMC meetings, and the Fed officials' (chair, vice chair, and Governors) speeches. In addition, the minutes of the FOMC meetings were subjected to a phase analysis of changes in each policy stance since 1971.","Wed, 7 Jun 2023 09:23:26 UTC (533 KB)"
75,Patient Dropout Prediction in Virtual Health: A Multimodal Dynamic Knowledge Graph and Text Mining Approach,"Shuang Geng, Wenli Zhang, Jiaheng Xie, Gemin Liang, Ben Niu",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Virtual health has been acclaimed as a transformative force in healthcare delivery. Yet, its dropout issue is critical that leads to poor health outcomes, increased health, societal, and economic costs. Timely prediction of patient dropout enables stakeholders to take proactive steps to address patients' concerns, potentially improving retention rates. In virtual health, the information asymmetries inherent in its delivery format, between different stakeholders, and across different healthcare delivery systems hinder the performance of existing predictive methods. To resolve those information asymmetries, we propose a Multimodal Dynamic Knowledge-driven Dropout Prediction (MDKDP) framework that learns implicit and explicit knowledge from doctor-patient dialogues and the dynamic and complex networks of various stakeholders in both online and offline healthcare delivery systems. We evaluate MDKDP by partnering with one of the largest virtual health platforms in China. MDKDP improves the F1-score by 3.26 percentage points relative to the best benchmark. Comprehensive robustness analyses show that integrating stakeholder attributes, knowledge dynamics, and compact bilinear pooling significantly improves the performance. Our work provides significant implications for healthcare IT by revealing the value of mining relations and knowledge across different service modalities. Practically, MDKDP offers a novel design artifact for virtual health platforms in patient dropout management.","Tue, 6 Jun 2023 16:23:00 UTC (2,417 KB)[v2] Wed, 7 Jun 2023 14:36:30 UTC (2,397 KB)"
76,Explaining Hate Speech Classification with Model Agnostic Methods,"Durgesh Nandini, Ute Schmid",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"There have been remarkable breakthroughs in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, notably in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Additionally, hate speech detection in dialogues has been gaining popularity among Natural Language Processing researchers with the increased use of social media. However, as evidenced by the recent trends, the need for the dimensions of explainability and interpretability in AI models has been deeply realised. Taking note of the factors above, the research goal of this paper is to bridge the gap between hate speech prediction and the explanations generated by the system to support its decision. This has been achieved by first predicting the classification of a text and then providing a posthoc, model agnostic and surrogate interpretability approach for explainability and to prevent model bias. The bidirectional transformer model BERT has been used for prediction because of its state of the art efficiency over other Machine Learning models. The model agnostic algorithm LIME generates explanations for the output of a trained classifier and predicts the features that influence the model decision. The predictions generated from the model were evaluated manually, and after thorough evaluation, we observed that the model performs efficiently in predicting and explaining its prediction. Lastly, we suggest further directions for the expansion of the provided research work.","Tue, 30 May 2023 19:52:56 UTC (537 KB)"

However, a significant challenge nowadays is maintaining performance when we use a lightweight model with limited labelled samples. We present DisCo, a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework for fine-tuning a cohort of small student models generated from a large PLM using knowledge distillation. Our key insight is to share complementary knowledge among distilled student cohorts to promote their SSL effectiveness. DisCo employs a novel co-training technique to optimize a cohort of multiple small student models by promoting knowledge sharing among students under diversified views: model views produced by different distillation strategies and data views produced by various input augmentations. We evaluate DisCo on both semi-supervised text classification and extractive summarization tasks. Experimental results show that DisCo can produce student models that are 7.6 times smaller and 4.8 times faster in inference than the baseline PLMs while maintaining comparable performance. We also show that DisCo-generated student models outperform the similar-sized models elaborately tuned in distinct tasks.","Sat, 20 May 2023 03:23:16 UTC (7,299 KB)[v2] Mon, 16 Oct 2023 11:39:50 UTC (455 KB)[v3] Fri, 20 Oct 2023 02:11:16 UTC (654 KB)"
80,Comparing Variation in Tokenizer Outputs Using a Series of Problematic and Challenging Biomedical Sentences,"Christopher Meaney, Therese A Stukel, Peter C Austin, Michael Escobar",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Background & Objective: Biomedical text data are increasingly available for research. Tokenization is an initial step in many biomedical text mining pipelines. Tokenization is the process of parsing an input biomedical sentence (represented as a digital character sequence) into a discrete set of word/token symbols, which convey focused semantic/syntactic meaning. The objective of this study is to explore variation in tokenizer outputs when applied across a series of challenging biomedical sentences. Method: Diaz [2015] introduce 24 challenging example biomedical sentences for comparing tokenizer performance. In this study, we descriptively explore variation in outputs of eight tokenizers applied to each example biomedical sentence. The tokenizers compared in this study are the NLTK white space tokenizer, the NLTK Penn Tree Bank tokenizer, Spacy and SciSpacy tokenizers, Stanza/Stanza-Craft tokenizers, the UDPipe tokenizer, and R-tokenizers. Results: For many examples, tokenizers performed similarly effectively; however, for certain examples, there were meaningful variation in returned outputs. The white space tokenizer often performed differently than other tokenizers. We observed performance similarities for tokenizers implementing rule-based systems (e.g. pattern matching and regular expressions) and tokenizers implementing neural architectures for token classification. Oftentimes, the challenging tokens resulting in the greatest variation in outputs, are those words which convey substantive and focused biomedical/clinical meaning (e.g. x-ray, IL-10, TCR/CD3, CD4+ CD8+, and (Ca2+)-regulated). Conclusion: When state-of-the-art, open-source tokenizers from Python and R were applied to a series of challenging biomedical example sentences, we observed subtle variation in the returned outputs.","Mon, 15 May 2023 16:46:47 UTC (32 KB)"

With growing internet connectivity to personal life, an enormous amount of documents had been available in the public domain and thus making data annotation a tedious task. We address this challenge using self-supervision and unlike, the few existing self-supervised document segmentation approaches which use text mining and textual labels, we use a complete vision-based approach in pre-training without any ground-truth label or its derivative. Instead, we generate pseudo-layouts from the document images to pre-train an image encoder to learn the document object representation and localization in a self-supervised framework before fine-tuning it with an object detection model.

83,Patent Mining by Extracting Functional Analysis Information Modelled As Graph Structure: A Patent Knowledge-base Collaborative Building Approach,"Manal E. Helal, Mohammed E. Helal",Databases (cs.DB),"Patents provide a rich source of information about design innovations. Patent mining techniques employ various technologies, such as text mining, machine learning, natural language processing, and ontology-building techniques. An automated graph data modelling method is proposed for extracting functional representations for building a semantic database of patents of mechanical designs. The method has several benefits: The schema-free characteristic of the proposed graph modelling enables the ontology it is based on to evolve and generalise to upper ontologies across technology domains and to specify lower ontologies to more specific domains. Graph modelling benefits from enhanced performance of deep queries across many levels of relationships and interactions and provides efficient storage. Graph modelling also enables visualisation libraries to use the graph data structure immediately, avoiding the need for graph extraction programs from relational databases. Patent/Design comparisons are computed by search queries using counting of overlaps of different levels and weights. This work has produced the PatMine SolidWorks Add-in \c{opyright}, which compares annotated CAD designs with patents and highlights overlapping design concepts. The patent annotation extracts its functional analysis, representing its structure as geometric feature interactions. Additional features such as full-text search and semantic search of the PatMine patents database are available, and graph analytic methods and machine learning algorithms are enabled and can be implemented as plug-ins in future work.

Integration of the knowledge scattered across this large body of literature could provide key insights into physiological mechanisms and disease processes leading to novel medical interventions. However, it is a great challenge for researchers to utilize this information in full since the scale and complexity of the data greatly surpasses human processing abilities. This becomes especially problematic in cases of extreme urgency like the COVID-19 pandemic. Automated text mining can help extract and connect information from the large body of medical research articles. The first step in text mining is typically the identification of specific classes of keywords (e.g., all protein or disease names), so called Named Entity Recognition (NER). Here we present an end-to-end pipeline for NER of typical entities found in medical research articles, including diseases, cells, chemicals, genes/proteins, and species. The pipeline can access and process large medical research article collections (PubMed, CORD-19) or raw text and incorporates a series of deep learning models fine-tuned on the HUNER corpora collection. In addition, the pipeline can perform dictionary-based NER related to COVID-19 and other medical topics. Users can also load their own NER models and dictionaries to include additional entities. The output consists of publication-ready ranked lists and graphs of detected entities and files containing the annotated texts. An associated script allows rapid inspection of the results for specific entities of interest. As model use cases, the pipeline was deployed on two collections of autophagy-related abstracts from PubMed and on the CORD19 dataset, a collection of 764 398 research article abstracts related to COVID-19.","Sun, 16 Apr 2023 15:17:56 UTC (2,167 KB)"

Meanwhile, in the highly sensitive domains, e.g., healthcare and legal long-text mining, potential model distrust, yet underrated and underexplored, may hatch vital apprehension. Existing methods generally segment the long text, encode each piece with the pre-trained model, and use attention or RNNs to obtain long text representation for classification. In this work, we propose a simple but effective model, Segment-aWare multIdimensional PErceptron (SWIPE), to replace attention/RNNs in the above framework. Unlike prior efforts, SWIPE can effectively learn the label of the entire text with supervised training, while perceive the labels of the segments and estimate their contributions to the long-text labeling in an unsupervised manner. As a general classifier, SWIPE can endorse different encoders, and it outperforms SOTA models in terms of classification accuracy and model efficiency. It is noteworthy that SWIPE achieves superior interpretability to transparentize long text classification results.","Tue, 4 Apr 2023 08:49:39 UTC (331 KB)"

The extraction of keywords with respective contextual events in Twitter data is a big challenge. The challenging issues are mainly because of the informality in the language used. The use of misspelled words, acronyms, and ambiguous terms causes informality. The extraction of keywords with informal language in current systems is pattern based or event based. In this paper, contextual keywords are extracted using thematic events with the help of data association. The thematic context for events is identified using the uncertainty principle in the proposed system. The thematic contexts are weighed with the help of vectors called thematic context vectors which signifies the event as certain or uncertain. The system is tested on the Twitter COVID-19 dataset and proves to be effective. The system extracts event-specific thematic context vectors from the test dataset and ranks them. The extracted thematic context vectors are used for the clustering of contextual thematic vectors which improves the silhouette coefficient by 0.5% than state of art methods namely TF and TF-IDF.

The success of securing the return of these remains to their communities for reburial depends largely on locating information within scientific and other literature published between 1790 and 1970 documenting their theft, donation, sale, or exchange between institutions. This article reports on collaborative research by data scientists and social science researchers in the Research, Reconcile, Renew Network (RRR) to develop and apply text mining techniques to identify this vital information. We describe our work to date on developing a machine learning-based solution to automate the process of finding and semantically analysing relevant texts. Classification models, particularly deep learning-based models, are known to have low accuracy when trained with small amounts of labelled (i.e. relevant/non-relevant) documents. To improve the accuracy of our detection model, we explore the use of an Informed Neural Network (INN) model that describes documentary content using expert-informed contextual knowledge. Only a few labelled documents are used to provide specificity to the model, using conceptually related keywords identified by RRR experts in provenance research. The results confirm the value of using an INN network model for identifying relevant documents related to the investigation of the global commercial trade in Indigenous human remains. Empirical analysis suggests that this INN model can be generalized for use by other researchers in the social sciences and humanities who want to extract relevant information from large textual corpora.","Sat, 25 Mar 2023 14:08:21 UTC (920 KB)"

These models have exhibited exceptional performance in a variety of tasks, such as question answering, essay composition, and code generation. However, their effectiveness in the healthcare sector remains uncertain. In this study, we seek to investigate the potential of ChatGPT to aid in clinical text mining by examining its ability to extract structured information from unstructured healthcare texts, with a focus on biological named entity recognition and relation extraction. However, our preliminary results indicate that employing ChatGPT directly for these tasks resulted in poor performance and raised privacy concerns associated with uploading patients' information to the ChatGPT API. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new training paradigm that involves generating a vast quantity of high-quality synthetic data with labels utilizing ChatGPT and fine-tuning a local model for the downstream task. Our method has resulted in significant improvements in the performance of downstream tasks, improving the F1-score from 23.37% to 63.99% for the named entity recognition task and from 75.86% to 83.59% for the relation extraction task. Furthermore, generating data using ChatGPT can significantly reduce the time and effort required for data collection and labeling, as well as mitigate data privacy concerns. In summary, the proposed framework presents a promising solution to enhance the applicability of LLM models to clinical text mining.","Wed, 8 Mar 2023 03:56:31 UTC (6,205 KB)[v2] Mon, 10 Apr 2023 18:47:51 UTC (6,200 KB)"

Over a thousand of such questions and answers are covered in a period from 1995 to early 2023. Given computational analysis based on text mining, the results indicate that (a) data protection has been actively debated in the Parliament during the past twenty years. No noticeable longitudinal trends are present; the debates have been relatively constant. As could be expected, (b) the specific data protection laws in the EU have frequently been referenced in these debates, which (c) do not seem to align along conventional political dimensions such as the left-right axis. Furthermore, (d) numerous distinct data protection topics have been debated by the parliamentarians, indicating that data protection politics in the EU go well-beyond the recently enacted regulations.","Mon, 20 Feb 2023 12:08:37 UTC (79 KB)"

Several Gaussian mixture model based biclustering approach currently exist in the literature. However, they impose severe restrictions on the structure of the covariance matrix. Here, we propose a Gaussian mixture model-based bi-clustering approach that provides a more flexible block-diagonal covariance structure. We show that the clustering accuracy of the proposed model is comparable to other known techniques but our approach provides a more flexible covariance structure and has substantially lower computational time. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model in bioinformatics and topic modelling.","Wed, 8 Feb 2023 02:47:26 UTC (9,539 KB)"
98,Precursor recommendation for inorganic synthesis by machine learning materials similarity from scientific literature,"Tanjin He, Haoyan Huo, Christopher J. Bartel, Zheren Wang, Kevin Cruse, Gerbrand Ceder",Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci),"Synthesis prediction is a key accelerator for the rapid design of advanced materials. However, determining synthesis variables such as the choice of precursor materials is challenging for inorganic materials because the sequence of reactions during heating is not well understood. In this work, we use a knowledge base of 29,900 solid-state synthesis recipes, text-mined from the scientific literature, to automatically learn which precursors to recommend for the synthesis of a novel target material. The data-driven approach learns chemical similarity of materials and refers the synthesis of a new target to precedent synthesis procedures of similar materials, mimicking human synthesis design. When proposing five precursor sets for each of 2,654 unseen test target materials, the recommendation strategy achieves a success rate of at least 82%. Our approach captures decades of heuristic synthesis data in a mathematical form, making it accessible for use in recommendation engines and autonomous laboratories.","Sun, 5 Feb 2023 04:57:59 UTC (2,856 KB)[v2] Fri, 19 May 2023 23:15:16 UTC (2,806 KB)"
99,Bioformer: an efficient transformer language model for biomedical text mining,"Li Fang, Qingyu Chen, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Zhiyong Lu, Kai Wang",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Pretrained language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, BERT has been adapted to the biomedical domain. Despite the effectiveness, these models have hundreds of millions of parameters and are computationally expensive when applied to large-scale NLP applications. We hypothesized that the number of parameters of the original BERT can be dramatically reduced with minor impact on performance. In this study, we present Bioformer, a compact BERT model for biomedical text mining. We pretrained two Bioformer models (named Bioformer8L and Bioformer16L) which reduced the model size by 60% compared to BERTBase. Bioformer uses a biomedical vocabulary and was pre-trained from scratch on PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central full-text articles. We thoroughly evaluated the performance of Bioformer as well as existing biomedical BERT models including BioBERT and PubMedBERT on 15 benchmark datasets of four different biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering and document classification. The results show that with 60% fewer parameters, Bioformer16L is only 0.1% less accurate than PubMedBERT while Bioformer8L is 0.9% less accurate than PubMedBERT. Both Bioformer16L and Bioformer8L outperformed BioBERTBase-v1.1. In addition, Bioformer16L and Bioformer8L are 2-3 fold as fast as PubMedBERT/BioBERTBase-v1.1. Bioformer has been successfully deployed to PubTator Central providing gene annotations over 35 million PubMed abstracts and 5 million PubMed Central full-text articles. We make Bioformer publicly available via this https URL, including pre-trained models, datasets, and instructions for downstream use.","Fri, 3 Feb 2023 08:04:59 UTC (617 KB)"

Recent Transformers-based summarization models have presented a promising approach to abstractive summarization. They go beyond sentence selection and extractive strategies to deal with more complicated tasks such as novel word generation and sentence paraphrasing. Nonetheless, these models have a prominent shortcoming; their training strategy is not quite efficient, which restricts the model's performance. In this paper, we include a curriculum learning approach to reweigh the training samples, bringing about an efficient learning procedure. We apply our model on extreme summarization dataset of MentSum posts -- a dataset of mental health related posts from Reddit social media. Compared to the state-of-the-art model, our proposed method makes substantial gains in terms of Rouge and Bertscore evaluation metrics, yielding 3.5% (Rouge-1), 10.4% (Rouge-2), and 4.7% (Rouge-L), 1.5% (Bertscore) relative improvements.","Thu, 2 Feb 2023 08:48:26 UTC (10,408 KB)"

One of the most popular inference approaches to topic models is perhaps collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS), which typically samples one single topic label for each observed document-word pair. In this paper, we aim at improving the inference of CGS for topic models. We propose to leverage state augmentation technique by maximizing the number of topic samples to infinity, and then develop a new inference approach, called infinite latent state replication (ILR), to generate robust soft topic assignment for each given document-word pair. Experimental results on the publicly available datasets show that ILR outperforms CGS for inference of existing established topic models.","Wed, 25 Jan 2023 17:07:25 UTC (3,093 KB)"
102,Understanding Finetuning for Factual Knowledge Extraction from Language Models,"Mehran Kazemi, Sid Mittal, Deepak Ramachandran",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Language models (LMs) pretrained on large corpora of text from the web have been observed to contain large amounts of various types of knowledge about the world. This observation has led to a new and exciting paradigm in knowledge graph construction where, instead of manual curation or text mining, one extracts knowledge from the parameters of an LM. Recently, it has been shown that finetuning LMs on a set of factual knowledge makes them produce better answers to queries from a different set, thus making finetuned LMs a good candidate for knowledge extraction and, consequently, knowledge graph construction. In this paper, we analyze finetuned LMs for factual knowledge extraction. We show that along with its previously known positive effects, finetuning also leads to a (potentially harmful) phenomenon which we call Frequency Shock, where at the test time the model over-predicts rare entities that appear in the training set and under-predicts common entities that do not appear in the training set enough times. We show that Frequency Shock leads to a degradation in the predictions of the model and beyond a point, the harm from Frequency Shock can even outweigh the positive effects of finetuning, making finetuning harmful overall. We then consider two solutions to remedy the identified negative effect: 1- model mixing and 2- mixture finetuning with the LM's pre-training task. The two solutions combined lead to significant improvements compared to vanilla finetuning.","Thu, 26 Jan 2023 18:29:50 UTC (200 KB)"

Butte, Ewoud Schuit, Maarten van Smeden, Artuur M. Leeuwenberg",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Objective: Text mining of clinical notes embedded in electronic medical records is increasingly used to extract patient characteristics otherwise not or only partly available, to assess their association with relevant health outcomes. As manual data labeling needed to develop text mining models is resource intensive, we investigated whether off-the-shelf text mining models developed at external institutions, together with limited within-institution labeled data, could be used to reliably extract study variables to conduct association studies. Materials and Methods: We developed multiple text mining models on different combinations of within-institution and external-institution data to extract social factors from discharge reports of intensive care patients. Subsequently, we assessed the associations between social factors and having a do-not-resuscitate/intubate code. Results: Important differences were found between associations based on manually labeled data compared to text-mined social factors in three out of five cases. Adopting external-institution text mining models using manually labeled within-institution data resulted in models with higher F1-scores, but not in meaningfully different associations. Discussion: While text mining facilitated scaling analyses to larger samples leading to discovering a larger number of associations, the estimates may be unreliable. Confirmation is needed with better text mining models, ideally on a larger manually labeled dataset. Conclusion: The currently used text mining models were not sufficiently accurate to be used reliably in an association study. Model adaptation using within-institution data did not improve the estimates. Further research is needed to set conditions for reliable use of text mining in medical research.","Mon, 16 Jan 2023 19:04:59 UTC (1,573 KB)"

For example, they typically look at single and sometimes simplified tasks, and do not discuss in-depth data heterogeneity and inconsistency that is common in real-world problems or their implication on the development of their methods. Also, few prior work has focused on the healthcare domain. In this work, we describe an industry project that developed text mining and NLP solutions to mine millions of heterogeneous, multilingual procurement documents in the healthcare sector. We extract structured procurement contract data that is used to power a platform for dynamically assessing supplier risks. Our work makes unique contributions in a number of ways. First, we deal with highly heterogeneous, multilingual data and we document our approach to tackle these challenges. This is mainly based on a method that effectively uses domain knowledge and generalises to multiple text mining and NLP tasks and languages. Second, applying this method to mine millions of procurement documents, we develop the first structured procurement contract database that will help facilitate the tendering process.

This paper investigates BOP system's main failures using an LSA-based methodology. A total of 1312 failure records from companies worldwide were collected from the International Association of Drilling Contractors' RAPID-S53 database. The database contains recordings of halted drilling operations due to BOP system's failures and component's function deviations. The main failure scenarios of the components annular preventer, shear rams preventer, compensated chamber solenoid valve, and hydraulic regulators were identified using the proposed methodology. The scenarios contained valuable information about corrective maintenance procedures, such as frequently observed failure modes, detection methods used, suspected causes, and corrective actions. The findings highlighted that the major failures of the components under consideration were leakages caused by damaged elastomeric seals. The majority of the failures were detected during function and pressure tests with the BOP system in the rig. This study provides an alternative safety analysis that contributes to understanding blowout preventer system's critical component failures by applying a methodology based on a well-established text mining technique and analyzing failure records from an international database.","Mon, 2 Jan 2023 19:15:19 UTC (2,359 KB)"
107,ClusTop: An unsupervised and integrated text clustering and topic extraction framework,"Zhongtao Chen, Chenghu Mi, Siwei Duo, Jingfei He, Yatong Zhou",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Text clustering and topic extraction are two important tasks in text mining. Usually, these two tasks are performed separately. For topic extraction to facilitate clustering, we can first project texts into a topic space and then perform a clustering algorithm to obtain clusters. To promote topic extraction by clustering, we can first obtain clusters with a clustering algorithm and then extract cluster-specific topics. However, this naive strategy ignores the fact that text clustering and topic extraction are strongly correlated and follow a chicken-and-egg relationship. Performing them separately fails to make them mutually benefit each other to achieve the best overall performance. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised text clustering and topic extraction framework (ClusTop) which integrates text clustering and topic extraction into a unified framework and can achieve high-quality clustering result and extract topics from each cluster simultaneously. Our framework includes four components: enhanced language model training, dimensionality reduction, clustering and topic extraction, where the enhanced language model can be viewed as a bridge between clustering and topic extraction. On one hand, it provides text embeddings with a strong cluster structure which facilitates effective text clustering; on the other hand, it pays high attention on the topic related words for topic extraction because of its self-attention architecture. Moreover, the training of enhanced language model is unsupervised. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and provide benchmarks for different model combinations in this framework.","Tue, 3 Jan 2023 03:26:26 UTC (3,565 KB)"
108,IRT2: Inductive Linking and Ranking in Knowledge Graphs of Varying Scale,"Felix Hamann, Adrian Ulges, Maurice Falk",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"We address the challenge of building domain-specific knowledge models for industrial use cases, where labelled data and taxonomic information is initially scarce. Our focus is on inductive link prediction models as a basis for practical tools that support knowledge engineers with exploring text collections and discovering and linking new (so-called open-world) entities to the knowledge graph. We argue that - though neural approaches to text mining have yielded impressive results in the past years - current benchmarks do not reflect the typical challenges encountered in the industrial wild properly. Therefore, our first contribution is an open benchmark coined IRT2 (inductive reasoning with text) that (1) covers knowledge graphs of varying sizes (including very small ones), (2) comes with incidental, low-quality text mentions, and (3) includes not only triple completion but also ranking, which is relevant for supporting experts with discovery tasks. We investigate two neural models for inductive link prediction, one based on end-to-end learning and one that learns from the knowledge graph and text data in separate steps. These models compete with a strong bag-of-words baseline. The results show a significant advance in performance for the neural approaches as soon as the available graph data decreases for linking. For ranking, the results are promising, and the neural approaches outperform the sparse retriever by a wide margin.","Mon, 2 Jan 2023 15:19:21 UTC (436 KB)"
109,"Explainable AI for Bioinformatics: Methods, Tools, and Applications","Md.

However, complex DNNs or ML models, which are often perceived as opaque and black-box, can make it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their decisions. This lack of transparency can be a challenge for both end-users and decision-makers, as well as AI developers. Additionally, in sensitive areas like healthcare, explainability and accountability are not only desirable but also legally required for AI systems that can have a significant impact on human lives. Fairness is another growing concern, as algorithmic decisions should not show bias or discrimination towards certain groups or individuals based on sensitive attributes. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to overcome the opaqueness of black-box models and provide transparency in how AI systems make decisions. Interpretable ML models can explain how they make predictions and the factors that influence their outcomes. However, most state-of-the-art interpretable ML methods are domain-agnostic and evolved from fields like computer vision, automated reasoning, or statistics, making direct application to bioinformatics problems challenging without customization and domain-specific adaptation. In this paper, we discuss the importance of explainability in the context of bioinformatics, provide an overview of model-specific and model-agnostic interpretable ML methods and tools, and outline their potential caveats and drawbacks. Besides, we discuss how to customize existing interpretable ML methods for bioinformatics problems. Nevertheless, we demonstrate how XAI methods can improve transparency through case studies in bioimaging, cancer genomics, and text mining.","Sun, 25 Dec 2022 21:00:36 UTC (4,845 KB)[v2] Thu, 9 Feb 2023 14:10:57 UTC (5,362 KB)[v3] Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:48:26 UTC (5,362 KB)"

Tafti",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent chronic joint disease worldwide, where knee OA takes more than 80% of commonly affected joints. Knee OA is not a curable disease yet, and it affects large columns of patients, making it costly to patients and healthcare systems. Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of knee OA might be argued by variability in its clinical and physical manifestations. Although knee OA carries a list of well-known terminology aiming to standardize the nomenclature of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes of the chronic joint disease, in practice there is a wide range of terminology associated with knee OA across different data sources, including but not limited to biomedical literature, clinical notes, healthcare literacy, and health-related social media. Among these data sources, the scientific articles published in the biomedical literature usually make a principled pipeline to study disease. Rapid yet, accurate text mining on large-scale scientific literature may discover novel knowledge and terminology to better understand knee OA and to improve the quality of knee OA diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The present works aim to utilize artificial neural network strategies to automatically extract vocabularies associated with knee OA diseases. Our finding indicates the feasibility of developing word embedding neural networks for autonomous keyword extraction and abstraction of knee OA.","Thu, 22 Dec 2022 18:12:27 UTC (2,506 KB)"
111,Graph-based Semantical Extractive Text Analysis,Mina Samizadeh,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"In the past few decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available data produced from various sources with different topics. The availability of this enormous data necessitates us to adopt effective computational tools to explore the data. This leads to an intense growing interest in the research community to develop computational methods focused on processing this text data. A line of study focused on condensing the text so that we are able to get a higher level of understanding in a shorter time. The two important tasks to do this are keyword extraction and text summarization. In keyword extraction, we are interested in finding the key important words from a text. This makes us familiar with the general topic of a text. In text summarization, we are interested in producing a short-length text which includes important information about the document. The TextRank algorithm, an unsupervised learning method that is an extension of the PageRank (algorithm which is the base algorithm of Google search engine for searching pages and ranking them) has shown its efficacy in large-scale text mining, especially for text summarization and keyword extraction. this algorithm can automatically extract the important parts of a text (keywords or sentences) and declare them as the result. However, this algorithm neglects the semantic similarity between the different parts. In this work, we improved the results of the TextRank algorithm by incorporating the semantic similarity between parts of the text. Aside from keyword extraction and text summarization, we develop a topic clustering algorithm based on our framework which can be used individually or as a part of generating the summary to overcome coverage problems.","Mon, 19 Dec 2022 18:30:26 UTC (371 KB)"

Manually labeling training data for the BioNER task is costly, however, due to the significant domain expertise required for accurate annotation. The resulting data scarcity causes current BioNER approaches to be prone to overfitting, to suffer from limited generalizability, and to address a single entity type at a time (e.g., gene or disease).

However, applying such techniques in the wild, i.e., in both cybercriminal and regular online social media, differs from more general applications in that its defining characteristics are both domain and process dependent. This gives rise to a number of challenges of which contemporary research has only scratched the surface. More specifically, a text mining approach applied on social media communications typically has no control over the dataset size, the number of available communications will vary across users. Hence, the system has to be robust towards limited data availability. Additionally, the quality of the data cannot be guaranteed. As a result, the approach needs to be tolerant to a certain degree of linguistic noise (for example, abbreviations, non-standard language use, spelling variations and errors). Finally, in the context of cybercriminal fora, it has to be robust towards deceptive or adversarial behaviour, i.e. offenders who attempt to hide their criminal intentions (obfuscation) or who assume a false digital persona (imitation), potentially using coded language. In this work we present a comprehensive survey that discusses the problems that have already been addressed in current literature and review potential solutions.

There are significant gaps in the application of TM and related automation techniques in the areas of data extraction, monitoring, quality assessment and data synthesis. There is thus a need for continued progress in this area, and this is expected to ultimately significantly facilitate the construction of systematic literature reviews.","Sun, 20 Nov 2022 04:42:14 UTC (987 KB)[v2] Sun, 30 Jul 2023 18:57:07 UTC (980 KB)"
121,"Method for Determining the Similarity of Text Documents for the Kazakh language, Taking Into Account Synonyms: Extension to TF-IDF",Bakhyt Bakiyev,Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"The task of determining the similarity of text documents has received considerable attention in many areas such as Information Retrieval, Text Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics. Transferring data to numeric vectors is a complex task where algorithms such as tokenization, stopword filtering, stemming, and weighting of terms are used. The term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is the most widely used term weighting method to facilitate the search for relevant documents. To improve the weighting of terms, a large number of TF-IDF extensions are made. In this paper, another extension of the TF-IDF method is proposed where synonyms are taken into account. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by experiments on functions such as Cosine, Dice and Jaccard to measure the similarity of text documents for the Kazakh language.","Tue, 22 Nov 2022 15:54:41 UTC (335 KB)"

There are few datasets for keyphrase generation in the biomedical domain and they do not meet the expectations in terms of size for training generative models. In this paper, we introduce kp-biomed, the first large-scale biomedical keyphrase generation dataset with more than 5M documents collected from PubMed abstracts. We train and release several generative models and conduct a series of experiments showing that using large scale datasets improves significantly the performances for present and absent keyphrase generation.

123,Explainable Model-specific Algorithm Selection for Multi-Label Classification,"Ana Kostovska, Carola Doerr, Sašo Džeroski, Dragi Kocev, Panče Panov, Tome Eftimov",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Multi-label classification (MLC) is an ML task of predictive modeling in which a data instance can simultaneously belong to multiple classes. MLC is increasingly gaining interest in different application domains such as text mining, computer vision, and bioinformatics. Several MLC algorithms have been proposed in the literature, resulting in a meta-optimization problem that the user needs to address: which MLC approach to select for a given dataset? To address this algorithm selection problem, we investigate in this work the quality of an automated approach that uses characteristics of the datasets - so-called features - and a trained algorithm selector to choose which algorithm to apply for a given task. For our empirical evaluation, we use a portfolio of 38 datasets. We consider eight MLC algorithms, whose quality we evaluate using six different performance metrics. We show that our automated algorithm selector outperforms any of the single MLC algorithms, and this is for all evaluated performance measures. Our selection approach is explainable, a characteristic that we exploit to investigate which meta-features have the largest influence on the decisions made by the algorithm selector. Finally, we also quantify the importance of the most significant meta-features for various domains.","Mon, 21 Nov 2022 07:42:11 UTC (4,434 KB)"
124,Coronavirus statistics causes emotional bias: a social media text mining perspective,"Linjiang Guo, Zijian Feng, Yuxue Chi, Mingzhu Wang, Yijun Liu",Computers and Society (cs.CY),"While COVID-19 has impacted humans for a long time, people search the web for pandemic-related information, causing anxiety. From a theoretic perspective, previous studies have confirmed that the number of COVID-19 cases can cause negative emotions, but how statistics of different dimensions, such as the number of imported cases, the number of local cases, and the number of government-designated lockdown zones, stimulate people's emotions requires detailed understanding. In order to obtain the views of people on COVID-19, this paper first proposes a deep learning model which classifies texts related to the pandemic from text data with place labels. Next, it conducts a sentiment analysis based on multi-task learning. Finally, it carries out a fixed-effect panel regression with outputs of the sentiment analysis. The performance of the algorithm shows a promising result. The empirical study demonstrates while the number of local cases is positively associated with risk perception, the number of imported cases is negatively associated with confidence levels, which explains why citizens tend to ascribe the protracted pandemic to foreign factors. Besides, this study finds that previous pandemic hits cities recover slowly from the suffering, while local governments' spending on healthcare can improve the situation. Our study illustrates the reasons for risk perception and confidence based on different sources of statistical information due to cognitive bias. It complements the knowledge related to epidemic information. It also contributes to a framework that combines sentiment analysis using advanced deep learning technology with the empirical regression method.","Wed, 16 Nov 2022 03:36:13 UTC (544 KB)"
125,Auto-outlier Fusion Technique for Chest X-ray classification with Multi-head Attention Mechanism,"Yuru Jing, Zixuan Li",Image and Video Processing (eess.IV),"A chest X-ray is one of the most widely available radiological examinations for diagnosing and detecting various lung illnesses. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides an extensive database, ChestX-ray8 and ChestXray14, to help establish a deep learning community for analysing and predicting lung diseases. ChestX-ray14 consists of 112,120 frontal-view X-ray images of 30,805 distinct patients with text-mined fourteen disease image labels, where each image has multiple labels and has been utilised in numerous research in the past. To our current knowledge, no previous study has investigated outliers and multi-label impact for a single X-ray image during the preprocessing stage. The effect of outliers is mitigated in this paper by our proposed auto-outlier fusion technique. The image label is regenerated by concentrating on a particular factor in one image. The final cleaned dataset will be used to compare the mechanisms of multi-head self-attention and multi-head attention with generalised max-pooling.","Tue, 15 Nov 2022 09:35:49 UTC (1,113 KB)"
126,GeoAI for Knowledge Graph Construction: Identifying Causality Between Cascading Events to Support Environmental Resilience Research,"Yuanyuan Tian, Wenwen Li",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Knowledge graph technology is considered a powerful and semantically enabled solution to link entities, allowing users to derive new knowledge by reasoning data according to various types of reasoning rules. However, in building such a knowledge graph, events modeling, such as that of disasters, is often limited to single, isolated events. The linkages among cascading events are often missing in existing knowledge graphs. This paper introduces our GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence) solutions to identify causality among events, in particular, disaster events, based on a set of spatially and temporally-enabled semantic rules. Through a use case of causal disaster events modeling, we demonstrated how these defined rules, including theme-based identification of correlated events, spatiotemporal co-occurrence constraint, and text mining of event metadata, enable the automatic extraction of causal relationships between different events. Our solution enriches the event knowledge base and allows for the exploration of linked cascading events in large knowledge graphs, therefore empowering knowledge query and discovery.","Fri, 11 Nov 2022 05:31:03 UTC (1,690 KB)"

This led to the rapid growth of the number of online texts in the Arabic language. The enormous amount of text must be organized into classes to make the analysis process and text retrieval easier. Text classification is, therefore, a key component of text mining. There are numerous systems and approaches for categorizing literature in English, European (French, German, Spanish), and Asian (Chinese, Japanese). In contrast, there are relatively few studies on categorizing Arabic literature due to the difficulty of the Arabic language. In this work, a brief explanation of key ideas relevant to Arabic text mining are introduced then a new classification system for the Arabic language is presented using light stemming and Classifier Naïve Bayesian (CNB). Texts from two classes: politics and sports, are included in our corpus. Some texts are added to the system, and the system correctly classified them, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system.","Fri, 4 Nov 2022 22:25:13 UTC (1,320 KB)"

129,Can Current Explainability Help Provide References in Clinical Notes to Support Humans Annotate Medical Codes?,"Byung-Hak Kim, Zhongfen Deng, Philip S. Yu, Varun Ganapathi",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"The medical codes prediction problem from clinical notes has received substantial interest in the NLP community, and several recent studies have shown the state-of-the-art (SOTA) code prediction results of full-fledged deep learning-based methods. However, most previous SOTA works based on deep learning are still in early stages in terms of providing textual references and explanations of the predicted codes, despite the fact that this level of explainability of the prediction outcomes is critical to gaining trust from professional medical coders. This raises the important question of how well current explainability methods apply to advanced neural network models such as transformers to predict correct codes and present references in clinical notes that support code prediction. First, we present an explainable Read, Attend, and Code (xRAC) framework and assess two approaches, attention score-based xRAC-ATTN and model-agnostic knowledge-distillation-based xRAC-KD, through simplified but thorough human-grounded evaluations with SOTA transformer-based model, RAC. We find that the supporting evidence text highlighted by xRAC-ATTN is of higher quality than xRAC-KD whereas xRAC-KD has potential advantages in production deployment scenarios. More importantly, we show for the first time that, given the current state of explainability methodologies, using the SOTA medical codes prediction system still requires the expertise and competencies of professional coders, even though its prediction accuracy is superior to that of human coders. This, we believe, is a very meaningful step toward developing explainable and accurate machine learning systems for fully autonomous medical code prediction from clinical notes.","Fri, 28 Oct 2022 04:06:07 UTC (96 KB)"
130,Machine and Deep Learning Methods with Manual and Automatic Labelling for News Classification in Bangla Language,"Istiak Ahmad, Fahad AlQurashi, Rashid Mehmood",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has increasingly become important due to applications such as text classification, text mining, sentiment analysis, POS tagging, named entity recognition, textual entailment, and many others. This paper introduces several machine and deep learning methods with manual and automatic labelling for news classification in the Bangla language. We implemented several machine (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The ML algorithms are Logistic Regression (LR), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), used with Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Doc2Vec embedding models. The DL algorithms are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), used with Word2vec, Glove, and FastText word embedding models. We develop automatic labelling methods using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and investigate the performance of single-label and multi-label article classification methods. To investigate performance, we developed from scratch Potrika, the largest and the most extensive dataset for news classification in the Bangla language, comprising 185.51 million words and 12.57 million sentences contained in 664,880 news articles in eight distinct categories, curated from six popular online news portals in Bangladesh for the period 2014-2020. GRU and Fasttext with 91.83% achieve the highest accuracy for manually-labelled data. For the automatic labelling case, KNN and Doc2Vec at 57.72% and 75% achieve the highest accuracy for single-label and multi-label data, respectively. The methods developed in this paper are expected to advance research in Bangla and other languages.","Wed, 19 Oct 2022 21:53:49 UTC (8,571 KB)"

In this work, we evaluate a broad set of machine learning techniques ranging from simple RNNs to specialised transformers such as BioBERT on a dataset containing clinical notes along with a set of annotations indicating whether a sample is cancer-related or not. Furthermore, we specifically employ efficient fine-tuning methods from NLP, namely, bottleneck adapters and prompt tuning, to adapt the models to our specialised task. Our evaluations suggest that fine-tuning a frozen BERT model pre-trained on natural language and with bottleneck adapters outperforms all other strategies, including full fine-tuning of the specialised BioBERT model. Based on our findings, we suggest that using bottleneck adapters in low-resource situations with limited access to labelled data or processing capacity could be a viable strategy in biomedical text mining.

132,SMTCE: A Social Media Text Classification Evaluation Benchmark and BERTology Models for Vietnamese,"Luan Thanh Nguyen, Kiet Van Nguyen, Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Text classification is a typical natural language processing or computational linguistics task with various interesting applications. As the number of users on social media platforms increases, data acceleration promotes emerging studies on Social Media Text Classification (SMTC) or social media text mining on these valuable resources. In contrast to English, Vietnamese, one of the low-resource languages, is still not concentrated on and exploited thoroughly. Inspired by the success of the GLUE, we introduce the Social Media Text Classification Evaluation (SMTCE) benchmark, as a collection of datasets and models across a diverse set of SMTC tasks. With the proposed benchmark, we implement and analyze the effectiveness of a variety of multilingual BERT-based models (mBERT, XLM-R, and DistilmBERT) and monolingual BERT-based models (PhoBERT, viBERT, vELECTRA, and viBERT4news) for tasks in the SMTCE benchmark. Monolingual models outperform multilingual models and achieve state-of-the-art results on all text classification tasks. It provides an objective assessment of multilingual and monolingual BERT-based models on the benchmark, which will benefit future studies about BERTology in the Vietnamese language.","Wed, 21 Sep 2022 16:33:46 UTC (195 KB)"

Past research has extensively investigated who innovators are and how they behave in work-related activities. In this paper, we suggest that it is necessary to analyze how innovators behave in other contexts, such as in informal communication spaces, where knowledge is shared without formal structure, rules, and work obligations. Drawing on communication and network theory, we analyze about 38,000 posts available in the intranet forum of a large multinational company. From this, we explain how innovators differ from other employees in terms of social network behavior and language characteristics. Through text mining, we find that innovators write more, use a more complex language, introduce new concepts/ideas, and use positive but factual-based language. Understanding how innovators behave and communicate can support the decision-making processes of managers who want to foster innovation.","Tue, 20 Sep 2022 07:01:25 UTC (572 KB)"
134,HAPI: A Large-scale Longitudinal Dataset of Commercial ML API Predictions,"Lingjiao Chen, Zhihua Jin, Sabri Eyuboglu, Christopher Ré, Matei Zaharia, James Zou",Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Commercial ML APIs offered by providers such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft have dramatically simplified ML adoption in many applications. Numerous companies and academics pay to use ML APIs for tasks such as object detection, OCR and sentiment analysis. Different ML APIs tackling the same task can have very heterogeneous performance. Moreover, the ML models underlying the APIs also evolve over time. As ML APIs rapidly become a valuable marketplace and a widespread way to consume machine learning, it is critical to systematically study and compare different APIs with each other and to characterize how APIs change over time. However, this topic is currently underexplored due to the lack of data. In this paper, we present HAPI (History of APIs), a longitudinal dataset of 1,761,417 instances of commercial ML API applications (involving APIs from Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and other providers) across diverse tasks including image tagging, speech recognition and text mining from 2020 to 2022. Each instance consists of a query input for an API (e.g., an image or text) along with the API's output prediction/annotation and confidence scores. HAPI is the first large-scale dataset of ML API usages and is a unique resource for studying ML-as-a-service (MLaaS). As examples of the types of analyses that HAPI enables, we show that ML APIs' performance change substantially over time--several APIs' accuracies dropped on specific benchmark datasets. Even when the API's aggregate performance stays steady, its error modes can shift across different subtypes of data between 2020 and 2022. Such changes can substantially impact the entire analytics pipelines that use some ML API as a component. We further use HAPI to study commercial APIs' performance disparities across demographic subgroups over time. HAPI can stimulate more research in the growing field of MLaaS.","Sun, 18 Sep 2022 01:52:16 UTC (5,406 KB)"

137,Twitter Attribute Classification with Q-Learning on Bitcoin Price Prediction,"Sattarov Otabek, Jaeyoung Choi",Social and Information Networks (cs.SI),"Aspiring to achieve an accurate Bitcoin price prediction based on people's opinions on Twitter usually requires millions of tweets, using different text mining techniques (preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, stop word removal), and developing a machine learning model to perform the prediction. These attempts lead to the employment of a significant amount of computer power, central processing unit (CPU) utilization, random-access memory (RAM) usage, and time. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider a classification of tweet attributes that effects on price changes and computer resource usage levels while obtaining an accurate price prediction. To classify tweet attributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all Bitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four categories based on the following tweet attributes: $(i)$ the number of followers of the tweet poster, $(ii)$ the number of comments on the tweet, $(iii)$ the number of likes, and $(iv)$ the number of retweets. We separately train and test by using the Q-learning model with the above four categorized sets of tweets and find the best accurate prediction among them. Especially, we design several reward functions to improve the prediction accuracy of the Q-leaning. We compare our approach with a classic approach where all Bitcoin-related tweets are used as input data for the model, by analyzing the CPU workloads, RAM usage, memory, time, and prediction accuracy. The results show that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most influence on a future price, and their utilization leads to spending 80\% less time, 88.8\% less CPU consumption, and 12.5\% more accurate predictions compared with the classic approach.","Thu, 4 Aug 2022 12:18:07 UTC (9,285 KB)[v2] Fri, 9 Jun 2023 06:11:53 UTC (8,786 KB)"

One feasible approach is to take relation extraction and function detection as two independent sub-tasks. However, this separate learning method ignores the intrinsic correlation between them and leads to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a joint learning model, which combines entity relation extraction and entity function detection to exploit their commonality and capture their inter-relationship, so as to improve the performance of biomedical causal relation extraction. Meanwhile, during the model training stage, different function types in the loss function are assigned different weights. Specifically, the penalty coefficient for negative function instances increases to effectively improve the precision of function detection. Experimental results on the BioCreative-V Track 4 corpus show that our joint learning model outperforms the separate models in BEL statement extraction, achieving the F1 scores of 58.4% and 37.3% on the test set in Stage 2 and Stage 1 evaluations, respectively.

Hunter",Genomics (q-bio.GN),"Preeclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Currently, the only definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery of the placenta, which is central to the pathogenesis of the disease. Transcriptional profiling of human placenta from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia has been extensively performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The decisions to investigate DEGs experimentally are biased by many factors, causing many DEGs to remain uninvestigated. A set of DEGs which are associated with a disease experimentally, but which have no known association to the disease in the literature are known as the ignorome. Preeclampsia has an extensive body of scientific literature, a large pool of DEG data, and only one definitive treatment. Tools facilitating knowledge-based analyses, which are capable of combining disparate data from many sources in order to suggest underlying mechanisms of action, may be a valuable resource to support discovery and improve our understanding of this disease. In this work we demonstrate how a biomedical knowledge graph (KG) can be used to identify novel preeclampsia molecular mechanisms. Existing open source biomedical resources and publicly available high-throughput transcriptional profiling data were used to identify and annotate the function of currently uninvestigated preeclampsia-associated DEGs. Experimentally investigated genes associated with preeclampsia were identified from PubMed abstracts using text-mining methodologies. The relative complement of the text-mined- and meta-analysis-derived lists were identified as the uninvestigated preeclampsia-associated DEGs (n=445), i.e., the preeclampsia ignorome. Using the KG to investigate relevant DEGs revealed 53 novel clinically relevant and biologically actionable mechanistic associations.","Thu, 28 Jul 2022 03:29:09 UTC (1,304 KB)[v2] Sun, 2 Oct 2022 21:18:58 UTC (1,307 KB)"

142,Learning from what we know: How to perform vulnerability prediction using noisy historical data,"Aayush Garg, Renzo Degiovanni, Matthieu Jimenez, Maxime Cordy, Mike Papadakis, Yves LeTraon",Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Vulnerability prediction refers to the problem of identifying system components that are most likely to be vulnerable. Typically, this problem is tackled by training binary classifiers on historical data. Unfortunately, recent research has shown that such approaches underperform due to the following two reasons: a) the imbalanced nature of the problem, and b) the inherently noisy historical data, i.e., most vulnerabilities are discovered much later than they are introduced. This misleads classifiers as they learn to recognize actual vulnerable components as non-vulnerable. To tackle these issues, we propose TROVON, a technique that learns from known vulnerable components rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as typically performed. We perform this by contrasting the known vulnerable, and their respective fixed components. This way, TROVON manages to learn from the things we know, i.e., vulnerabilities, hence reducing the effects of noisy and unbalanced data. We evaluate TROVON by comparing it with existing techniques on three security-critical open source systems, i.e., Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, and Wireshark, with historical vulnerabilities that have been reported in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Our evaluation demonstrates that the prediction capability of TROVON significantly outperforms existing vulnerability prediction techniques such as Software Metrics, Imports, Function Calls, Text Mining, Devign, LSTM, and LSTM-RF with an improvement of 40.84% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score under Clean Training Data Settings, and an improvement of 35.52% under Realistic Training Data Settings.","Fri, 22 Jul 2022 11:45:20 UTC (228 KB)[v2] Mon, 25 Jul 2022 07:42:11 UTC (1 KB) (withdrawn)"

Text mining tools are researched and proposed in literature in order to gain value and perform trend topics and sentiment analysis on Twitter. As data are the fuels for these models, the ""right"" ones, i.e the domain-related ones makes a difference on their accuracy. In this paper, we describe a pipeline of \textit{DataOps / MLOps} operations performed over a tourism related Twitter dataset in order to comprehend tourism motivation and interest. The gained knowledge can be exploit, by the travel/hospitality industry in order to develop data-driven strategic service, and by travelers which can consume relevant information about tourist destination.","Thu, 30 Jun 2022 17:11:04 UTC (3,388 KB)"
146,BertNet: Harvesting Knowledge Graphs with Arbitrary Relations from Pretrained Language Models,"Shibo Hao, Bowen Tan, Kaiwen Tang, Bin Ni, Xiyan Shao, Hengzhe Zhang, Eric P. Xing, Zhiting Hu",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"It is crucial to automatically construct knowledge graphs (KGs) of diverse new relations to support knowledge discovery and broad applications. Previous KG construction methods, based on either crowdsourcing or text mining, are often limited to a small predefined set of relations due to manual cost or restrictions in text corpus. Recent research proposed to use pretrained language models (LMs) as implicit knowledge bases that accept knowledge queries with prompts. Yet, the implicit knowledge lacks many desirable properties of a full-scale symbolic KG, such as easy access, navigation, editing, and quality assurance. In this paper, we propose a new approach of harvesting massive KGs of arbitrary relations from pretrained LMs. With minimal input of a relation definition (a prompt and a few shot of example entity pairs), the approach efficiently searches in the vast entity pair space to extract diverse accurate knowledge of the desired relation. We develop an effective search-and-rescore mechanism for improved efficiency and accuracy. We deploy the approach to harvest KGs of over 400 new relations from different LMs. Extensive human and automatic evaluations show our approach manages to extract diverse accurate knowledge, including tuples of complex relations (e.g., ""A is capable of but not good at B""). The resulting KGs as a symbolic interpretation of the source LMs also reveal new insights into the LMs' knowledge capacities.","Tue, 28 Jun 2022 19:46:29 UTC (1,055 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Dec 2022 18:13:13 UTC (1,211 KB)[v3] Fri, 2 Jun 2023 17:54:54 UTC (8,319 KB)"
147,Depth-based clustering analysis of directional data,"Giuseppe Pandolfo, Antonio D'ambrosio",Methodology (stat.ME),"A new depth-based clustering procedure for directional data is proposed. Such method is fully non-parametric and has the advantages to be flexible and applicable even in high dimensions when a suitable notion of depth is adopted. The introduced technique is evaluated through an extensive simulation study. In addition, a real data example in text mining is given to explain its effectiveness in comparison with other existing directional clustering algorithms.","Tue, 21 Jun 2022 14:55:51 UTC (2,414 KB)"
148,Born for Auto-Tagging: Faster and better with new objective functions,"Chiung-ju Liu, Huang-Ting Shieh",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Keyword extraction is a task of text mining. It is applied to increase search volume in SEO and ads. Implemented in auto-tagging, it makes tagging on a mass scale of online articles and photos efficiently and accurately. BAT is invented for auto-tagging which served as awoo's AI marketing platform (AMP). awoo AMP not only provides service as a customized recommender system but also increases the converting rate in E-commerce. The strength of BAT converges faster and better than other SOTA models, as its 4-layer structure achieves the best F scores at 50 epochs. In other words, it performs better than other models which require deeper layers at 100 epochs. To generate rich and clean tags, awoo creates new objective functions to maintain similar ${\rm F_1}$ scores with cross-entropy while enhancing ${\rm F_2}$ scores simultaneously. To assure the even better performance of F scores awoo revamps the learning rate strategy proposed by Transformer \cite{Transformer} to increase ${\rm F_1}$ and ${\rm F_2}$ scores at the same time.","Wed, 15 Jun 2022 02:52:22 UTC (6,155 KB)[v2] Tue, 31 Oct 2023 04:26:51 UTC (952 KB)"
149,EMS: Efficient and Effective Massively Multilingual Sentence Representation Learning,"Zhuoyuan Mao, Chenhui Chu, Sadao Kurohashi",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Massively multilingual sentence representation models, e.g., LASER, SBERT-distill, and LaBSE, help significantly improve cross-lingual downstream tasks. However, multiple training procedures, the use of a large amount of data, or inefficient model architectures result in heavy computation to train a new model according to our preferred languages and domains. To resolve this issue, we introduce efficient and effective massively multilingual sentence representation learning (EMS), using cross-lingual sentence reconstruction (XTR) and sentence-level contrastive learning as training objectives. Compared with related studies, the proposed model can be efficiently trained using significantly fewer parallel sentences and GPU computation resources without depending on large-scale pre-trained models. Empirical results show that the proposed model significantly yields better or comparable results with regard to bi-text mining, zero-shot cross-lingual genre classification, and sentiment classification. Ablative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed model. We release the codes for model training and the EMS pre-trained model, which supports 62 languages (this https URL).","Tue, 31 May 2022 12:29:25 UTC (2,655 KB)"
150,Computational Reproducibility Within Prognostics and Health Management,"Tim von Hahn, Chris K. Mechefske",Digital Libraries (cs.DL),"Scientific research frequently involves the use of computational tools and methods. Providing thorough documentation, open-source code, and data -- the creation of reproducible computational research -- helps others understand a researcher's work. Here, we explore computational reproducibility, broadly, and from within the field of prognostics and health management (PHM). The adoption of reproducible computational research practices remains low across scientific disciplines and within PHM. Our text mining of more than 300 articles, from publications engaged in PHM research, showed that fewer than 1% of researchers made their code and data available to others. Although challenges remain, there are also clear opportunities, and benefits, for engaging in reproducible computational research. Highlighting an opportunity, we introduce an open-source software tool, called PyPHM, to assist PHM researchers in accessing and preprocessing common industrial datasets.","Tue, 31 May 2022 01:00:47 UTC (949 KB)[v2] Tue, 13 Sep 2022 16:29:01 UTC (990 KB)"
