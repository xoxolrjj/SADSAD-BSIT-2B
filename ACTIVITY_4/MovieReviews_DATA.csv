"1","Phantom Thread","siderite","18 June 2018","8/10","You will either like it or hate it","This is obviously a carefully crafted film: from the scenes, the acting, the words, the clothes, the facial and body movements, the music, it is all careful and artistic. That being said, it is terribly descriptive: an obsessive dress maker finds his muse in a strange woman who wants him to be hers alone. There is nothing else, just their play back and forth, and then the film ends. If you are here for the quality of film making, then you will probably like the film. If you want some insight into human psyche, this is a good film to learn from, with actors as dedicated as Lewis, Manville and Krieps. If you are looking for an interesting story that fills you with emotion and teaches you new things, you may be disappointed.It doesnt help that neither of the characters in this film is even remotely relatable. Lewis character is the typical obsessive genius that is careless of others and focuses on his work above all else. Yet he is not that much of a genius, just a failed human being with some temporary success and weird fetishes. Manvilles character is a stern woman whos only purpose in life seems to care for Lewis to the point of losing herself, to keep things in balance when his histrionics threaten the house. Krieps character is plain creepy. If you want something to make you fear women, this is a great start. She is concomitantly lovely and well intentioned and borderline psychotic.Bottom line: a very technical and artistic study on a rather boring subject and some unrelatable people."
"2","Phantom Thread","AlsExGal","18 December 2019","9/10","A most unusual romance","In early 1950s Britain, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the most sought-after dress designer among the rich and powerful. He lives a regimented, almost monastic life, with his watchful sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) as his close associate. One day Reynolds meets waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) and takes her on as his muse, model, lover, whatever he needs. Alma learns that shes not the first to fill this position in Reynolds life, but she becomes determined to be the last. I could care less about the fashion world or Haute Couture, and yet I still was drawn into the single-minded obsessive artistry of Reynolds world, his strict discipline and pursuit of perfection within his chosen field. Alma acts as an audience surrogate, unsure of this odd world led by the often inscrutable Reynolds and Cyril, the latter of whom often has the charm of an asp. But as Alma begins to see the way things work in this cloistered, rarefied world, she begins to find ways to upset it and bend it to her advantage. Cyril is naturally distrusting of this latest distraction, but Reynolds seems to find something in this new, shaky lifestyle of uncertainty. The performances are fantastic, with Day-Lewis once laying claim to the title of greatest actor of his generation. He complex, unique yet very real, without a single false note. Manville was also singled out for awards consideration, and shes scary, pitiful, powerful, and voice for order and tradition. Vicky Krieps, a native of Luxembourg, is subtle, sharp, and a match for Day-Lewis as the seemingly simple, unworldly Alma. The filmmaking is concise and largely unobtrusive, letting the characters do the work, often with silent looks and facial expressions. Director Anderson did not use a Director of Photography on this, instead working with the camera operators themselves. The result is spontaneous but not amateur looking, with a slight gritty haze that makes many scenes almost dream-like. Its not a look that I would like to see in a lot of films, but it works here among the chilly environments both exterior and interior. The score by Jonny Greenwood, guitarist and songwriter from Radiohead, is surprisingly subdued, mainly light piano pieces, with some flourishes when needed. I wont pretend that a lot of viewers will like this, as they might find it slow, pretentious, boring, or pointless. I certainly did not, and found it a deep, and even deeply disturbing, look at a unique type of love fostered by unusual people, told in a compelling, if quiet, way. This is more for the Masterpiece Theatre crowd than the Fast and the Furious crowd. I would rank this among the very best of the year 2017. Highly Recommended."
"3","Phantom Thread","classicsoncall","8/11/2018","7/10","There is an air of quiet death in this house and I do not like the way it smells.","This story might be considered in the realm of one getting in life what they deserve. There came a point in the film where it became completely ludicrous why Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his paramour Alma (Vicky Krieps) should have remained together. That would have been the first instance in which Alma went the poison mushroom route, and I was kind of intrigued that no one figured that out the first time around. But then, when Alma revealed the specifics of her cat and mouse game to Reynolds himself, I was convinced that these two maladjusted individuals were simply using each other for some twisted version of a relationship that in no way could have been considered love. Like a lot of reviewers here, I can appreciate the rich period detail of the picture, and the gowns designed by the House of Woodcock were elegantly exquisite. But the principal characters were not, for as one dimensional an individual as Reynolds was, Alma proved way beyond a reasonable doubt that she was a ball buster supreme in her own way. Both the toast scraping scene and that loooong pour of water meant to get on Reynolds nerves were classic in execution. Theres no denying that both Day-Lewis and Ms. Krieps were brilliant in their portrayals, though in the end, the story itself came across as rather pointless."
"4","Phantom Thread","TheLittleSongbird","2/3/2018","10/10","A divine phantom","Meaning visual boldness, the memorable way in how he uses music, how he handles thematic consistency and having characters that are flawed but realistically so while not being necessarily likeable. All present here. Jonny Greenwoods music score is as ever an interesting and layered in mood, hauntingly beautiful and clever one on its own, one that is not forgotten. Just as remarkable is the sympathetic way its used while being like its own character in the film. Undoubtedly the reason for its Oscar nomination. The pre-existing music makes every bit as much of an impression, perhaps even more so. Most of it classical, with a mix of solo piano, symphonic and especially chamber music (on top of popular songs from the period). They are either understatedly heard in the background, appropriate for a gentle piece like Faures Berceuse, or like characters of their own that enhance the intense mood of the scene in question, such as the Schubert and especially the Debussy (made to sound easy by the performance of the quartet, when its actually a nightmare, Debussy in general is hard having sung many of his songs and he can be unforgiving to vocalists).Throughout, Phantom Thread is very thoughtfully and even poetically scripted, with remarkable complexity. To make Alma an ambiguous character with vague motivations was an intriguing choice, and while it will no doubt frustrate viewers and will be considered a flaw it came over very well and only added to the realistically complicated dynamic of her relationship with Reynolds. In terms of the story, Phantom Thread is anchored by this relationship dynamic. It may not be a novel theme, with other films having done it (a recent example being Mother!), but Phantom Thread handles this far better than most of them, what it says about it is illuminating, fresh and surprisingly subtle. Also effective was how the high fashion world is portrayed, on the outside its glamorous in how it looks and is worn and methodical in how the dresses are made but behind the scenes there is bitterness and cruelness, a very truthful, if again not new, depiction and a relevant one by todays standards.Acting is throughout extremely good, superb with the three leads. Vicky Krieps is a powerful and subtle presence (very difficult to do with a character with as much ambiguity that Alma does), while Lesley Manville makes a somewhat thankless role terrifyingly formidable. But its Day-Lewis film, its perhaps his most personal role with a little of himself in Reynolds and Day-Lewis gives the performance of his life portraying a man with vulnerable sensitivity and erratic quirks and is simply mesmerising, his swan-song being one of his finest performances and one of the years overall best too. Am rooting for either him or Gary Oldman for Darkest Hour for the Best Actor Oscar.Its already been said that Reynolds is not a likeable or relatable character. To me, he is not likeable but he is flawed in a realistic way (as said a trademark of Anderson and one of his strongest examples) and personally could identify with his quirks and sensitivity, being an autistic person prone to sensitivity and erratic moods, a lot of difficulties and obstacles having to be faced all my life and having a few compulsive quirks of my own. Though not as extreme as those of Reynolds, still try to be nice and easy to get on with despite all this. Overall, a divine film. A long film and a slow one but hugely rewarding. An easy 10/10.

"5","Phantom Thread","Stay_away_from_the_Metropol","23 July 2018","10/10","A shattering glamorization of the toxicity that so many of us desire","PHANTOM THREAD just annihilated me. Its completely worthy of all the immense hype (such as, most cinephiles considering it the best film of 2017). It grows and builds in as organic a manner that a film possibly can. At first, I wasnt sure how I felt - I needed to get to know the characters, then, through most of the movie, I was cracking up at all the tension and the misery between them, then, by the last 10 minutes, I was in tears - a flow of tears which increased each minute as I processed the power and uniqueness and realness of what I had just witnessed. They were profound tears. I dont know that Ive ever seen a movie that so tastefully glamorizes the toxicity of love. The poison that so many of us romanticize, the poison that we NEED in our lives. There are two types of people in the world: people who feel at home in perfectly healthy relationships, and then theres the rest of us. This film is for the rest of us. It stands in a league of its own. I could never have expected the conclusion - the way that the ribbon is tied, the way the final thread is sewn. It hit me like a bag of bricks. It is all of the pain in love and all of the beauty, all at once. I have never seen this story told before. Its completely original, and completely shattering. The three leads are absolutely astonishing - Daniel Day Lewis and Lesley Manville are terrifying - Vicky Krieps is the most real. The writing and directing is impeccable - P.T. Andersons legacy continues, its fire burning brighter than ever. Yes, this is a masterpiece. I am dead."
"6","Phantom Thread","cliftonofun","6 October 2018","8/10","Quiet and crackling","Quiet movies are not usually my thing. I like pace and story and energy. But this film crackles in the quiet. PTA makes every scene feel like a battle, and the actors performances rise to that challenge. It may be a quiet movie about a dress maker, but it is so much more - a battle of wills, a tension against each seam, a few characters slowly resigning themselves to something other than what they planned. If you described the plot, I would be like, Really? That is the story? After watching it, I can say it is not just a story...it is a great story."
"7","Phantom Thread","blanche-2","15 October 2019","6/10","Daniel Day-Lewis final film","If I were Daniel Day-Lewis, and Im not, this would not be my farewell film. It is evident that he was intrigued by the character of Reynolds Woodcock, a dedicated fashion designer, seemingly devoid of any emotion except missing his dead mother. Woodcock lives a rigid, quiet life with his sister/major domo Cyril (Leslie Manville) who couldnt crack a smile if her life depended on it. He takes on young women as lovers and models, and out they go when hes throughAlong comes Alma (Vicky Krieps), his next model and eventual lover. She doesnt intend to be thrown out - ever. Shes a more subtle 50s version of the Glenn Close character in Fatal Attraction.Alma figures out that underneath that hard, disciplined shell is a man who is needy for love, more of a maternal love, perhaps. So what could be better than Munchausens by proxy?This story comes in a very glamorous, beautiful, atmospheric package, filled with gorgeous gowns, sumptuous gatherings, beautiful photography and sublime music. Take that all away and you have a Lifetime movie.Someone I know saw this and hated it, saying it was boring. I had to see it because of Daniel Day-Lewis - and he can elevate any script. The acting is wonderful from Vicky Krieps, Leslie Manville, and a neat performance by Harriet Samson Harris, another favorite.I admit the film was slow, but I wasnt bored. In that way, it was very European. I also admit I dont expect a lot of people on IMDb will be nuts about it, perhaps wanting something that moves a little faster.The major problem with the film for me was the fact that I couldnt warm up to any of the characters. I frankly thought Reynolds was a jerk, and I couldnt understand why Alma wanted to be with him until I realized she was a whack job. And Cyril - Mrs. Danvers in Rebecca comes off like Mother Theresa compared to her.Odd story, beautifully done."

"9","Phantom Thread","OlgaGorelik","19 November 2022","6/10","Exquisitely crafted, ruined when it turns incoherent","Phantom Thread is an exquisitely crafted film. Camera work, lighting, sound, music. Quirky, controlling, and slightly freakish dress designer Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) meets a meek and clumsy country waitress named Alma (Vicky Krieps). The characters are interesting, their relationship moves in a delightfully unpredictable manner. Until things start to get weird, and not in a good way. Towards the end neither the character development nor their actions make any sense.Nearly every dress designed by Woodcock in the film was exquisitely made yet had a weird element that ruined it. Maybe it was intentional. Maybe its just me. But I felt the same way about the film."
"10","Phantom Thread","zkzuber","3 August 2022","1/10","Khan Review","Bad very very bad boring slow pathetic irritating. I wasted my precious twenty minutes and later fast forwarded till end just to see what type of nerds can like such movie and who are those morons who nominates such movies for award. Disgustingly bad useless nonsense."
